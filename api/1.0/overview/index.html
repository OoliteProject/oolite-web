You can't scoop fuel with them but should you accidentally jettison some cargo or be lucky enough to stumble across some salvage then the goods are yours.
Also, when you buy your first new piece of equipment, there's a chance that something rather less important might get damaged instead.

Broadsides (5 lasers on sides): DTT Atlas, Heart of Gold, Serpent Class Cruiser.
Forward broadsides (5 separated forward lasers): Far Arm Corsair, Far Arm Hunter.
Broadsides in all 4 views: Kirin, Maelstrom.

Sniper Gun and Heavy Sniper Gun are also separable in SG variants of ships if there is enough space between mounts but Sapper is not separable.

Press 'i' for more info about Heavy Sniper Gun and Sapper mode of this weapon.

        Heavy Sniper Gun has 2x power but need large ship like Python HSG, Python BattleCruiser or Prototype Boa.
        Sapper is the overdrive mode of Sniper Gun: deliver 5x more damage at point blank range than at max. range but use 5x energy and make double heat. The 5x hit is within 500m, 2x at 2km, 1x at 20km. Note the base damage/second value is only the half than in Sniper mode, so at and within 500m provide 2.5x more damage than a Sniper Gun in the same time.  Cause some damage when a shot narrowly misses the target and can mine asteroids. You can set auto or manual switching between Sniper Gun and Sapper using Sapper Mode equipment. Anti-Sapper equipments and Hard Shields almost negate the effect. Can not be separated and break your cloak when you fire. Overheat can damage Sapper and reduce it to Sniper Gun, in this case you must repair Sapper Mode.";

Just don't linger in the station approach lane after you leave and get in the way, or else they won't be best pleased...

Recommended for new players learning how to dock manually, and for experienced players who want a bit of extra ambiance around main stations. Most messages from this OXP appear only if your ship does not have functional docking computers, but a few appear regardless, for example: Clear the lane, Commander! If you see a message that starts with 'Traffic Control:' then it is probably from this OXP.

This OXP is neutral for beginners and slightly biased against the experienced player, because it enforces (with fines and small but escalating bounties) a sensible rule against the use of cloaking devices in proximity to main stations... however, to be fair, it will not impose penalties if you pass undetected (or at least unidentified). Of course, requesting docking clearance or activating docking computers will transmit your identity to the station...

This OXP is compatible with all other OXPs, and includes considerations for Buoy Repair, ILS and AutoDock if those OXPs are also installed.";

It also moves other HUD elements to the edges of the screen, rather than grouping them around the scanner.

Feature summary:
- Centralised gauges around the crosshairs and giving them a uniform color.
- Fixes bug with witchspace destination label - shows next jump dest.
- Docked and inflight GUI huds.
- New crosshair images for each weapon type.
- Works with 16:10, 16:9 and 4:3 format displays.
- Allows 3rd party laser OXP's to configure the crosshairs.
- Automatic 40% glare reduction on all views.
- Automatically hides the HUD when an external view is selected.
- Implements the \"allow_big_gui\" option.
- Primable equipment allows HUD to be switched to \"hi-contrast\" mode, which is useful when sun-skimming.
- Amber color option

By granting the player a free escape pod they can escape at the cost of their cargo.
It's the one piece of equipment in the core (non-ironman) game that typically leaves you disadvantaged when you use it.
Starting again (or at least reloading a save) would actually be a less costly action in a great many cases, so as freebies go this is of questionable monetary value.

It is however a way to keep a game and the 'player story' going that might otherwise need to be restarted. The player pays for a bad encounter rather than being destroyed by it.
The penalty is losing your cargo, and some (often extensive) damage to your equipment, without also paying a 1,000 credits for the privilege (which is not even affordable from the standard game start).";

Combined with the core lasers, the options include:

     Ingram MegaBlast (power) and Dual 22-18 (speed) models

     Volt (power) and Hassoni (budget) models
Yellow: Beam lasers - rapid-fire

Green: Burst lasers - dogfighting

Cyan: Cannon lasers - sniping

Blue: Mining lasers - specialist
     Ingram (standard) and JK (power) models
Magenta: Military lasers - combat versatility
     Lance & Ferman (range) and Ergon (cool-running) models

Also includes an option for enabling some silly/over-powered lasers:

Pulse laser: the Frontier-Newton Yr1993 PlasmaCharger. Much like a standard pulse laser except that it kills things. Colour: thargoid green.

Defence laser: the Williams PewPew 1982 ('R'-type model). Make laser overheating a thing of the past (along with careful aiming) with this medium fire-rate laser. Colour: rose (whatever that is).

VariScan laser: ZeusCorp's Thunderbolt will smash up pretty much anything into little bits. Not the fastest fire rate but it 'packs a wallop'. Colour: white/yellow.

Beam laser: the Lucas NegForce (SithField) Generator fires a stream of intense, awe-inspiring energy at the target over medium range. According to some, the awe wears off after several uses. Colour: pink.

Burst laser: the QVC Ubertron 4000 can be yours for a bargain price with this one-time limited edition special offer. Make other pilots regret 'looking at you funny' with just a second or two of trigger action. Satisfaction guaranteed... Not recommended for the short tempered. Colour: white.

Laser Cannon: the mysterious DeXM-trope DoomLens is hard to find but extremely formidable. Aim, fire, kill; only the first one is difficult. This will suck energy like nobodies business. Colour: black (of course).

Mining laser: the Anderson ITC 'Belter' Sp.(1999) hits with such a hard radioactive blast that it's amazing any of the rock survives. Can be used under duress to do similar to ships. Exhibits a strange technology ahead of its years. Colour: azure (I'm struggling here).

Military Laser: introducing the RimmerAce Quadcooled ImpasseResolver. Yes, it's four times 'cooler' than any other military laser and is also the four times winner of the 'shiniest barrel' award. It just oozes class (in a leak-free, non-radiation hazard sense of course). Colour: blue/green.";
