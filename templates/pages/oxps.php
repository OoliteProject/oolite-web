<div id="oxppage">

<p>There are over five hundred expansion packs released for
Oolite. There are two expansion pack formats in use in Oolite 1.80,
usually referred to as OXZ and OXP. The OXZ format is more modern and
can be downloaded and installed automatically by the game by selecting
the "Manage Expansion Packs" option on the start screen. The OXP
format is older and must be installed manually. As the OXZ format is
currently new, many expansion packs are still only available in the older OXP format.</p>

<?php include("oxplinks.html"); ?>

<p>The table below lists the OXZ expansion packs which can be
automatically downloaded by Oolite 1.80, as well as links for manual
	 downloads if you prefer to do that. If you are still using Oolite 1.77.1 or an earlier version, OXZ format expansion packs will not be usable - you will be able to download OXP format expansions from other sites.</p>
