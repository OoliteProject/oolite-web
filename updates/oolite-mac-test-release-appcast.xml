<h3>Changes between Oolite 1.75 and Oolite 1.75.1:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Joystick deadzone restored to previous value (does not affect Mac OS X). (Bug <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=3577&17945>#17945</a>)</li>
<li> (Mac OS X) Support for game pads that don’t pretend to be joysticks.</li>
<li> (Windows) Uninstaller is now more discriminating about which files it deletes.</li>
<li> The fast docking button now defaults to the main station if within the aegis, even if it’s outside scanner range, as intended. (Bug <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=3577&bug_id=17923">#17923</a>)</li>
<li> Ship mass calculations, and thus mass lock behaviour, have been restored (except for very small ships). (Bug <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=3577&bug_id=17940">#17940</a>)</li>
<li> Thargoids no longer randomly shoot in entirely the wrong direction.</li>
<li> Fixed “jousting” behaviour where attacking ships would veer off after one hit.</li>
<li> Various fixes for wormhole behaviour in interstellar space, post-nova systems and with ships with escorts.</li>
<li> Interim fix for mass-dependent fuel prices not working. (Bug <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=3577&bug_id=17947">#17947</a>).</li>
<li> Various bug fixes and cosmetic tweaks, including but not limited to bugs <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=3577&bug_id=17944">#17944</a>, <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=3577&bug_id=17968">#17968</a>, <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=3577&bug_id=17975">#17975</a>, <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=3577&bug_id=17992">#17992</a>, <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=3577&bug_id=17993">#17993</a> and <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=3577&bug_id=17995">#17995</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>JavaScript:</h4>
<ul>
<li> JavaScript <code>Ship equipmentStatus()</code> now works for primary and secondary weapons.</li>
<li> Calling <code>spawn()</code> on a subentity previously put the spawnees near the witchpoint. It now works like calling <code>spawn()</code> on the parent ship, which is suboptimal but less confusing. Relying on the current begaviour is not recommended as it may be improved in future.</li>
<li> JavaScript <code>system.addShipsToRoute()</code> now adds ships within scanner range of the route, and ships added with <code>system.addGroupToRoute()</code> are clustered.</li>
<li> JavaScript <code>SystemInfo systemsInRange()</code> once again works as an instance method (which is now the recommended usage).</li>
<li> New ship event <code>entityDestroyed()</code>. This fires immediately <em>after</em> the ship becomes invalid, regardless of the reason, except when the game restarts.</li>
<li> New SystemInfo property internalCoordinates and new PlayerShip properties <code>cursorCoordinatesInLY</code>, <code>galacticHyperspaceFixedCoordsInLY</code> and <code>galaxyCoordinatesInLY</code>. This resolves the problem that different coordinate systems were being used for galactic coordinates in different contexts.</li>
<li> Mission screens can now be run in flight without generating warnings about the player being both docked and not docked. (Bug <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=3577&bug_id=17953">#17953</a>)</li>
