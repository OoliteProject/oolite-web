        <h3>Serpent_Class_Cruiser_V1.03_Readme_&amp; _License.txt</h3>
        <pre>Serpent Class Cruiser OXP by Shipbuilder.

A new ship from GalTech Industries. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
Ship: -

The Serpent Class Cruiser represents GalTech Industries Corporation�s attempt to capture a market share of the sales of Python Class Cruisers produced at Inera and the newer Boa Class 2 Cruisers.

In many ways the Serpent Class Cruiser closely compares with the Boa 2. Though slightly slower and generally considered not quite as manoeuvrable, what the designers have focused on is a new Quadflux reactor and shielding system. This system produces powerful shields and a superior energy recharge compared to that of the Boa 2.

The main selling point however is the modern design of the internal ship architecture. This is aimed specifically to ensure full compatibility with ship upgrades on the market including the option to fit fuel injectors, shield boosters and military shields whilst providing for a substantial cargo hold.

This balance of cargo space, speed, manoeuvrability and upgrade potential combined with its ability to withstand a sustained attack make the Serpent Class Cruiser an excellent choice for the discerning pilot and trader. Once equipped with the myriad of available upgrades the Serpent Class Cruiser, in the hands of a competent pilot, is easily a match for most aggressors.
