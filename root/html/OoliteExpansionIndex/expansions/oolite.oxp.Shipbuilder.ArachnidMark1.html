        <h3>Arachnid_Mark_1_V1.01_Readme_&amp; _License.txt</h3>
        <pre>Arachnid Mark 1 OXP by Shipbuilder.

A new ship from The GalTech Industries Corporation. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
Ship: -

The Arachnid Mark 1 is the GalTech Industries Corporation�s answer to Cowell &amp; MgRath�s phenomenally popular Cobra Mark 3. Produced at the shipyards in the Ceesxe, Gerete and Edle systems, and also under license at many other facilities throughout the 8 galaxies, the ship is becoming a popular choice for both traders and bounty hunters.

Invariably the ship has also found its way in to the hands of many unscrupulous privateers wishing to combine good combat capabilities with a craft able of transporting a reasonable amount of cargo.

Designed as a general purpose craft, the intention is to allow the owner to reconfigure the ship to suit their own individual requirements. As a result this craft is equally suitable for combat, trading and passenger transport as well as being capable of carrying out some of the smaller cargo contracts.

Early prototypes suffered from a poorly performing propulsion drive however this initial setback has now been overcome giving the Arachnid Mark 1 a slight advantage over the Cobra Mark 3 in terms of both speed and manoeuvrability. The profile of the craft is also approximately 80% that of the Cobra Mark 3 therefore making the ship a more difficult target to hit.

The downside to this improvement in performance and reduced size however is less internal space meaning that the maximum extended cargo capacity is 30T rather than the Cobra Mark 3�s 35T and that the maximum number of missiles is limited to 2.

In summary the Arachnid Mark 1 is very closely matched in comparison to the Cobra Mark 3 and the choice between the two appears to depend on the potential buyer�s preference for cargo transportation or combat.
