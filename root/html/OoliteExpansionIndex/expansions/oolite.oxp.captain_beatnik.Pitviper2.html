===============================


VERSION:
	1.1


DATE:
	2013-07-23


REQUIRES:
	Oolite Version 1.77.x


FEATURES:
	This .oxp adds the new Coluber CPV-12375 &quot;Pitviper Mk. II&quot; to the Ooniverse. This corvette-class combat vessel is a 
	further development of the original pitviper. It�s faster and has a better maneuverability and energy recharge rate 
	than the original pitviper, but less energy and less missile capacity. 

	Like the original pitviper the Mk II has forcefield-reinforced hull. Additionally the Mk. II has a cutting blade
	(&quot;daisycutter&quot;) on each fuselage. This enables the pilot to attack other ships by ramming. 
	But be careful! If the speed is too high (or the opponents ship is really big), even a reinforced hull may break. 
	
	CPV-12375 Pitviper stats:

	Size (metres, WxHxL) 57 x 52 x 94
	Cargo capacity: 12 TC
	Cargo bay extension: none 			(&quot;
	Maximum speed 0.375 LM 			
	Manoeuvrability Roll: 2.8
	Pitch: 1.2
	Yaw: 1.2
	Thrust: 50 				
	Energy banks: 8
	Energy recharge rate Very good (4.5)
	Gun mounts Fore, Aft		
	Missile slots 6
	Shield boosters available Yes
	Military shields available Yes
	Hyperspace capable Yes
	Available to player Yes
	Base price 515000 Cr

	A HUD designed especially for the Pitviper is also available. If you want to use the CPV2-HUD, just edit the shipdata.plist
	and delete the two slashes in front of the line &quot;hud = cb68_cpv2_hud.plist. Or just put the stand-alone-version of CPV2-HUD into
	your addons folder.

	Enjoy!

VERSION HISTORY:
=======================
	Version 1.0.0 
		*First release of this .OXP

	Version 1.1
		*shipdata.plist updated by Spara for Oolite 1.82

With my tweaks it does not appear as frequently as before and appears in proper roles. Naming is systematic with other ships in the Ooniverse. Accuracy has been removed as I think that these kinds of generic all over flying ships should not have it. Use skilled NPCs, if you want more challenge. Weapons have been downgraded to tone it down a bit further and to follow core guidelines.

Changes:

&quot;cb68_pitviper2-template&quot;

* added auto_weapons = yes;
* changed name from &quot;Pitviper Mk II&quot; to &quot;Pitviper Mark II&quot;
* changed ai_type to ai_type = &quot;oolite-pirateAI.js&quot;;

&quot;cb68_pitviper2&quot;

* changed roles from &quot;hunter(0.40) pirate(0.40) escort(0.40)&quot; to &quot;assassin-heavy(0.25) escort-heavy(0.25) hunter-medium(0.25) pirate-medium-fighter(0.25)&quot;

&quot;cb68_pitviper2-2&quot;

* removed ship, just better equipment and accuracy set to fixed number (5). auto_weapons should handle equipment and skilledNPCs OXP accuracy.

&quot;cb68_pitviper2-bountyhunter&quot;

* removed accuracy setting (8)
* removed special name &quot;Pitviper Mk II (Bountyhunter)&quot;
* changed roles from &quot;hunter(0.40)&quot; to &quot;hunter-heavy(0.5)&quot;
* changed forward weapon from &quot;WEAPON_MILITARY_LASER&quot; to &quot;WEAPON_BEAM_LASER&quot;

&quot;cb68_pitviper2-buccaneer&quot;

* removed accuracy setting (7)
* removed special name &quot;Pitviper Mk II (Buccaneer)&quot;
* changed roles from &quot;pirate(0.20)&quot; to &quot;pirate-heavy-fighter(0.25) pirate-interceptor(0.25) pirate-aegis-raider(0.25)&quot;
* changed forward weapon from &quot;WEAPON_MILITARY_LASER&quot; to &quot;WEAPON_BEAM_LASER&quot;

&quot;cb68_pitviper2-player&quot;

* changed name from &quot;Pitviper Mk II&quot; to &quot;Pitviper Mark II&quot;
