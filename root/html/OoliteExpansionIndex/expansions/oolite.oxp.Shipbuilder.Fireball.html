        <h3>Fireball_V1.01_Readme_&amp; _License.txt</h3>
        <pre>Fireball OXP by Shipbuilder.

A new ship from The GalTech Industries Corporation. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
Ship: -

The Fireball has been developed with versatility in mind. This multi-functional vessel is able to offer a combination of cargo carrying capacity and passenger transport capabilities whilst retaining above average combat characteristics.

Produced at the shipyards of the GalTech Industries Corporation in the Ceesxe, Gerete and Edle systems the ship has quickly established itself as a commercial success.

Though the standard model is offered with a basic level of equipment the �future-proof� design approach caters for a full range of additional upgrades.

It is however the hi-tech escape module which differentiates this ship from many others. Rather than providing the option to fit the ship with an escape pod and hope for a safe return to the nearest station the front section of the main ship, nicknamed the Junior, is automatically jettisoned just before the point of destruction.

The Junior, rather than being a slow unarmed pod, features front and rear lasers along with a respectable turn of speed and maneuverability. This may not be sufficient to outgun most attacking pirates but is intended to provide the ship�s crew with a much increased chance of survival.


--------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------
Ship variants: -

The ship is available as a player craft and also as NPC trader, pirate, hunter and police vessels.

All NPC ships can, in addition to the standard equipment listed above, be equipped with a range of upgrades.

The police version however is an upgraded model produced exclusively for GalCop by the GalTech Industries Corporation. With an upgraded power system police vessels are capable of greater speed, have an improved recharge rate, stronger shields and an upgraded laser system. Police craft also have substantially more equipment fitted as standard. 

The downside, however, for the upgraded police version is that the front section of the vessel, which serves as an escape module on the civilian version, is no longer detachable. The section of the front module which houses the propulsion system in the civilian versions instead accommodates additional systems including the upgraded power plant.


--------------------------------------------------------------
Standard equipment: -

Player ships - Forward pulse laser, fuel scoops and 1 missile. 
Pirate version - Forward beam laser, rear, port and starboard pulse lasers, escape capsule, fuel scoops and 1 missile.
Hunter version - Forward and rear beam lasers, port and starboard pulse lasers, escape capsule, fuel scoops and 1 missile.
Trader version - Forward beam laser, rear, port and starboard pulse lasers, escape capsule, fuel scoops and 1 missile.
Police version - Forward military, rear beam and port and starboard pulse lasers, ECM, 4 hardened missiles, fuel injectors and shield boosters.


--------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: -

The OXP was designed to work on Oolite 1.76 but should also be compatible with future versions (The shipdata.plist is incompatible with versions prior to v1.75 because of the use of the scan_class key). No additional OXPs are required to be installed in order for this OXP to run.


--------------------------------------------------------------
