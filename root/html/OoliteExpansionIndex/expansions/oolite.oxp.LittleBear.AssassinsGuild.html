        <pre>			    The Assassins Guild OXP - Version 1.3
			   -----------------------------------------
		                 (Updated 1st September:  2007)

(Update from V.1.0 - should fix the Case Senistivity bug on Unix and has some other small tweaks)
  (Update from V.1.2 - more code fixes, OXP will also now run on Oolite V1.69+, some AI tweaks)

(OXP Script / MissionText / Shipdata / AIs / New planets / Images &amp; Comms. Hails by &quot;LittleBear&quot;)

          (New &amp; Guest Ships by Ramon, Griff, Selezen, Murgh, Wombat, Wyvern &amp; Giles)

             (Text Adventure Location desciptions by LittleBear &amp; Captain Hesperus)

		(Features Commander McLane&#39;s External Views for the Player Ships)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This update to the OXP will enable the OXP to run properly on Oolite 1.69.1 onwards.
It will still run on 1.65. If you are playing on 1.69+ then when you have installed the .oxp
folder in AddOns, you MUST hold down the SHIFT key whilst Oolite loads up for the first time
after the install. This ensures the cache is cleared and updated.

This updated version also features Eric&#39;s mission clash prevention code. The OXP will not
therefore clash with other Oolite missions. If you have Military.oxp or Thargoid Wars.oxp
installed, ensure you are using the latest version (downloaded from the Wiki) as the old
versions of these OXPs can clash with Assassins. This version has been tested with the new
versions of Thargoid Wars and Military.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		        
An addon for Oolite by Giles Williams.

Based on &quot;Elite&quot; by Ian Bell and David Braben.

Nods to (have fun spotting the subtle references!) :-

The Deaths-Gate Cycle, Millers Crossing, Mobey Dick, Star Trek, Blade Runner, The Godfather,
The Hitch Hikers&#39; Guide to the Galaxy, Foundation Trilogy, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Kill Bill,
The Spaghetti Westerns Trilogy, Mad Max, The Dark Tower, The Dying Detective, Monty Python,
Star Wars, The Outlaw Josey Wales, The Labours of Hercules, The Terminator, Dark Star, Heat,
Dune, Dusk &#39;till Dawn, Scarface, The Gambler, Bowie: Space Oddity, 2001, Leon, The HPA Saga, and
(of course), Classic Elite!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADDED : 21 Missions (including 2 secret missions!), 30+ new NPC ships, 3 new player ships,
6 New weapons (1 can be used by the player), a new item of Player Equipment, extra stations
(some stations can be destroyed, one can be explored on foot whilst docked), New hails, New
Characters, New Multi-planet Systems, New NPC powers, a Galaxy 7 News service, scripted events /
NPC battles, An Assassins Guild Ranking, changing Systems data (player and NPC actions change
the Ooniverse!) and over 50 Mission Briefing Screens.

All these changes ONLY effect Galaxy 7. 

If you complete all the missions, then some of the OXP ships have a small chance of appearing in
any Galaxy as traders, pirates, police &amp; Military ships.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATES FROM BETA 7 :		

1) The &quot;Deathburger standin&quot; is replaced, so you can now play this Civil War Mission in its full
version. In the re-write three new Civil War Missions are added, one of which features two new
ships by Griff (You thought the Deamon Class Cruiser was a badass!), a new player weapon and
three new NPC only weapons.

2) You are now able to move around on foot in one station, in the form of a retro Text Adventure!

3) A little more detail is added to the F7 entries for the Systems OXPed, although because of the
way the Script works, you only see these extra touches if the OXP is played through from the
start. (No biggy - just a bit of polish and makes the System Descriptions more closley match the
Powers and Oranisations Wikki Page!).

3) More variety to the various NPC Hails added.

4) Shipyards added to all OXP stations. You can now buy ships as well as equipment when docked.
Equipment prices vary. Some are cheaper than normal, some are more expensive.

5) Groups of battleing Thargoids, BattleBots and Control Drones appear in Witchspace, once the
Navy develop these new ships.

6) Some code optimisations, that should make the OXP run better on slower systems.

7) 25 new mission briefings and some tweaks to existing ones. (Now has over 50 in total).

8) Reduced the Credits paid out for the last 2 hits.

9) Player Ships updated to use Commander McLane&#39;s External Views.

UPDATES FROM V1.0 :

1) Fixed the bug that caused Gravition Missiles to occasionally be fired by NPCs.

2) Improved the Code for the Dreadnaught Mission, to ensure a battle is always raging near
   the Dreadnaught and some tweaks to the AIs.

3) Some Typos and spelling errors in the Mission briefings fixed.

4) Plasma Senty Drone added to the ships appearing on the &quot;Press Space or Fire&quot; screen.

5) Davefaci PMed me a list of all the textures as the appear on Unix. I have gone through the
   Script, planetinfo and models to check the cases match up. This should fix the case
   senisitivity bug that caused crashes on Unix (but not Windows or Mac).

UPDATES FROM V1.1 :

1) I&#39;d missed one texture file case senisitivety bug (beatletext.png rather than PNG!)

2) Couple of missed typos in mission briefings fixed.

3) Redundent bit of code taken out of planetinfo.plist.

UPDATES FROM V1.2 :

1) Big case fix for Unix users. All the textures in the OXP now end .png rather than .PNG and all
   are called in script, planetinfo and the .dat files in lower case. Thanks Davifaci &amp; Lowhites!

2) Improved the hitspatrolAI (used by a lot of the special Cop and Military Units). Their primary
   Targets are still Thargoids, but they will fire on Offenders and vessals they spot committing
   crimes, if there are no Thargoids about.

3) Altered the order in which Commands are issued in script.

4) Some tidying up of the Shipdata file and removed redundant commands.

5) Adds Eric&#39;s mission clash prevention code to the script. If another OXP is using the Mission
   Screen, Assassins will wait until the player has seen the other mission briefing before
   displaying its own briefing. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What should I do if I have an old version of Assassins.oxp installed?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Save files work on all versions. Delete the old version of Assassins from AddOns and copy in
the new version of Assassins.oxp.

V1.0 onwards rewrote the &quot;Civil War missions&quot; and adds three more missions. If you
played the Beta, then you&#39;ll know mission 14 was unfinished. If you saw a News Broadcast
menitioning a raid by the police on &quot;Heretic Shipyards&quot;. This is the point at which the plot is
rewitten and the new missions inserted. If you have not seen this broadcast yet, then you don&#39;t
need to do anything (except put the new version of Assassins.oxp into AddOns)!

If you have played past this point on BETA7 or less and want to replay the OXP in its final
version, then you should edit your save-file to set the OXP back to this stage.

Open it up with Notepad (or other text editor) and type a search for &quot;mission_assassins&quot;.

You should see something like this:-

&lt;key&gt;mission_assassins&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;some text here&lt;/string&gt;

You need to change the text in the string to assassins_STAGE11 so it now reads:-

&lt;key&gt;mission_assassins&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;assassins_STAGE11&lt;/string&gt;

Now search for &quot;mission_assassins_jumpcount&quot;.

You should see somthing like this:-

&lt;key&gt;mission_assassins_jumpcount&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;a number here&lt;/string&gt;

Change the number in the string to 10, so it now reads:-

&lt;key&gt;mission_assassins_jumpcount&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;10&lt;/string&gt;

Now exit and save. When you load this Commander wait 15 seconds or so and the new version of
this News Broadcast will come up. The OXP will now run from this point and you will be able
to replay the new version of the &quot;Civil War&quot; missions. Be warned, its much tougher than
than it was in the Beta version!

Your Commander will of course need to be in G7 to trigger Assassins and have enough kills.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Ships &amp; Stations Credits
----------------------------

Vintage Adder, Team Bus, Team Minder, Nemesis, Special Branch Asp, Mongoose Fighter, Scorpion
Frigate, Daemon Class Cruiser, Military Wasp EX-1 &amp; Hooded Cobra by &quot;Ramon&quot;.

Malfunctioning Battlebots, Navy BattleBot MkI, Navy BattleBot MkII, Control Drone, Cluster Bomb,
Splinter Missiles, Aeron Class Frigate, Plasma Sentry &amp; Balrog Class Dreadnaught by &quot;Griff&quot;.

Guest Ships by &quot;Selezen&quot; (Rebel Cobra Njx), &quot;Murgh&quot; (Special Tugship) &quot;Wombat&quot; (Mine Sweeper
Satellite) Giles (Special Branch Base &amp; Military Base) &amp; &quot;Commander Wyvern&quot; (PTSF 200-X3)

All other ships and stations by &quot;LittleBear&quot;. (Sorry these ships aren&#39;t as cool model and
texture wise as the above ships, as I don&#39;t have the above authors&#39; knack for ship design. The
vast majority of the new ships and stations look really good as other Ooliters did them!)
 
NB: You DO NOT need to install any other OXPS for the ships to work. All the data, models and
textures necessary to run them are included in the Assassins.oxp 

I won&#39;t tell you anything about any new ships or stations here - That would spoil the surprise!

Some of OXP ships appear on the &quot;Press Space Commander&quot; Screen, so don&#39;t look at this (they come
up after the Native Ships), if you want to see them first in battle!

Systems OXPed
-------------

If you want to go sightseeing, the new planets, moons, gas giants, nebulas and extra stations are
added in the Galaxy 7 Systems of : Orramaor, Esrire, Tiared, Beatle, Geteve, Ateslete, Ataneris,
Quandixe, Estiri &amp; Eszausve. You will visit all these systems in the course of your work as 
an Assassin, but the planets and other new features are always present.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Big thanks to everyone who posted on &quot;Random Assassination Contracts&quot; &quot;Moving around Stations&quot;
and &quot;Assassins Guild - Beta&quot;. Many of your ideas have been incorporated into this OXP!

Thanks in particular to Giles, Ramon, Sleezen, Arexack_Heritic and Murgh for help in perfecting
the  1st draft of the &quot;victim1&quot; script &amp; shipdata and general technical help, helping me to get
this OXP off the drawing board. 

Thanks again to Ramon &amp; Griff for the new ships. Thanks to Sleezen, Murg, Wombat, Commander 
Wyvern and Giles for the loan of their ships. This OXP is very much a joint effort.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my first OXP and I learnt a lot by looking at the code for other OXPS (particularly
Spyhunter, Military, Diso, Lave, Hoopy Casino and Depossed).

Feel free to crib anything you like from this OXP to use in your own OXPs!

If you want to write an OXP for Oolite, grab anything you like from this OXP, fiddle with it,
mod it or do anything with it. Just don&#39;t sell it or charge for it!

Only thing I&#39;d ask is if you wanna use anything in another OXP could you just send me a PM
telling me what you are doing?

I&#39;d be flattered if somebody wanted to pick up a plot-thead or ship in another mod!

This is just so that if I pick up a plot thread in the furure, I don&#39;t want to duplicate somthing
sombody else has already done. Obviosuly if you grab somthing, remember to rename it so we don&#39;t
clash in code! Eg: If you want to grab and fiddle with the madbattlebotAI.plist call your
version somthing else as a file name, otherwise Oolite will get confused and read the
wrong .plist!

You will need to reach a minimum of 3,000 kills (and some other conditions), before you will have
seen everything this OXP offers.

OXP designers should read the text after &quot;Big Spoiler Warning!!!&quot;, as this gives the
planet numbers, ship names, mission variables, roles, AIs etc I have used in scripting this OXP. 
Please don&#39;t use the same, otherwise our OXPs will conflict! I playtested with all the other OXPs
installed, so there is no current conflict. This Section also gives a commentary on the Code
I have used, so may be helpful to desginers who want to try similar tricks in their OXPs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: General Oolite Mission Bug
-------------------------------------

A bug I have encountered occasionally as a player on the PC (both when playing native and OXP
missions) is that occasionally you will complete a mission and when you try to save, Oolite will
throw a complete woberly, refuse to save and reset to strict gameplay.

The workaround I found for this was to always save my Commander under a different name, EG:
JAMESON1, JAMESON2 etc. That way if this happened I could go back a stage load up JAMSESON2,
resave under a new name and then the bug did not happen.

I think this problem can effect any mission (it happened to me once when playtesting this OXP).
I have encountered it playing the native Thargoid Plans mission and at stages in both Ionics
and Deposesssed. I&#39;ve seen others posting reporting a similar bug. It very rarely happens,
but is annoying when it does!

As you will have seen from the size of the Download file this is a very big OXP, using 10
independant variables and over 60 stages. It would be incredibly annoying to be on the last stage
of the OXP, hit the bug and have to start over!

I would advise you therefore that when playing the OXP, you remember to ALWAYS save under a
new Commander name rather than overwriting a commander with the same name. That way, if you hit
the bug, reload and re-do the last stage and then save under a new Commander name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background
----------

In seedy space bars from Riedquat to Atoresra, hardened killers gather to drink fermented
vegetable products and tell tales of blood-curdling terror.

At such gatherings, stories are swapped of a sinister organization known as &quot;The Assassins
Guild&quot;. This semi-mythical association is said to operate in Galaxy 7. A killer who can
secure membership of &quot;The Brotherhood&quot; can expect huge rewards, and the most unpleasant
consequences for failure.

No self-respecting &quot;laser for hire&quot; should miss an opportunity to impress &quot;The Guildmaster&quot;.

Main Features
-------------

21 interlinked missions and assassinations (including two secret missions!), lots of new NPC
ships, three new player ships, extra stations (some stations can be destroyed, one can be
explored on foot whilst docked), a new item of player equipment, 6 new weapons (One can be used
by the player, 5 are NPC only), a Defense against the Q-mine is developed, 10 systems gain moons,
planets, nebulas and gas giants &amp; over 50 mission briefings with background images. 

The OXP also attempts to give more &quot;life&quot; to Galaxy 7 by featuring:- changing system descriptions
(as the actions of both the player and NPCs alter the Oniverse), G7 News broadcasts (keeping the
player up to date with Galactic Events), new interacting NPC powers (such as the Triads, the
Mafia and the Guild itself), Scripted events and scripted battles (such as a Thargoid Invasion),
Systems and fleets of ships controlled by NPC powers, over 30 new characters (with unique comms.
hails, AIs and flying individual ships) and to measure your skill as a hit-being, an Assassins
Guild Rating alongside the normal Elite Federation Rating.

As the OXP makes some fairly major changes to the Ooniverse, to avoid conflicts with other OXP
and native missions, Assassins missions and events will only occur in Galaxy 7. None of the
code in this OXP changes anything outside G7!

Sorry about the cost in hyperdrives to get there, but don&#39;t worry, the Guild will make it worth
your while. I needed a &quot;blank Galaxy&quot; to work on, given the numerous scripted features! 

Installing &amp; playing
--------------------

To play the OXP, unzip the download file. This will create a folder &quot;AssassinsV1_3&quot;. Open this
folder and you will see a folder named &quot;Assassins.oxp&quot; and this readme. Move the Assassins.oxp
folder to AddOns. Keep the readme somewhere safe! 

The first event will happen when you are docked at any main station in Galaxy 7 and have
more than 200 kills. No Assassins mission or event can trigger without the player having a
particular kill count. This is done to make the OXP playable by any Commander. If you are a noob
with a weedy ship, you won&#39;t be set upon (yet) by an army of nasties. You&#39;ll just be asked to
take some of the easy hits untill you have an Iron Ass. If you are an old-hand then the more
difficult missions will come up quickly, though you still need to do the easy hits first in order
to build up your status with the Guild.

The kill count requirement for Assassins missions is spaced roughly every 200 - 300 kills from
200 onwards. If you installed with 3,000+ kills, you would meet the kill count for all events.
Once kill count is met, a new event will happen once you have made a certain number of hyperspace
jumps, provided you completed the previous mission.

When the name &quot;Agent Wombat&quot; means something to you, you will have seen everything the OXP does.

Hang out in Galaxy 7, going about your ordinary Oolite business, and things will start
happening to you...

All of the Marks you will meet in this OXP will be flying ships with new models and textures.
Most of the Support Craft are also in new ships, but a few support craft will be flying
classic Elite ships - some with boosted stats.

I&#39;ve justified this in &quot;realism&quot; on the basis that the ordinary Triad grunt (for example)
wouldn�t be issued with some mega new ship (although his boss would), he just gets a well
equipped &quot;off the peg&quot; ship. However all characters get new AIs and hails, so a foot-solider in
a Gecko will behave as a Triad thug rather than a bog-standard Gecko!

Once you complete all the missions, the OXP ships are &quot;unlocked&quot; and you may see them appearing
as traders, pirates, police ships &amp; military ships as appropriate. The plot is left open-ended.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note on Difficulty
------------------

This is meant to be a challenging OXP, but you do not need to be in an Uber ship to complete it!
I have completed the OXP flying a well equipped Cobra Mk III. That said, if you wanna be an
Assassin, you should be equipped as suits your profession. You are not meant to be attempting
these missions in an Adder with a pulse laser!

The first hit is very easy (paying a measly 200C) and could be completed in the weakest ship, but
this is just a test by the Guild and completing it is one of the things you need to do to be
admitted into &quot;The Brotherhood&quot;. The first victim offered to you once you are a &quot;Brother&quot; is 
harder, but shouldn&#39;t cause you too much trouble. After that, the money and the difficulty starts
to mount up. The first difficult hit won&#39;t be offered until you have more than 1,000 kills, so it
is assumed you have a decent ship by this point.

Some of the hits offer large numbers of credits, but it is assumed that you will be tooling up
with (and using) mines, e-bombs and Hard-Head Missiles to complete them and probably having to
spend a fair bit of your fee on repairs! Invest your cash in your ship rather than the Worlds
End Bar and the missions should be hard, but do-able!

The only hint I&#39;m going to give you is to remember you are an assassin not a duelist. Your task
is to hit the Mark and get out of Dodge as fast as you can, rather than eliminate every ship in
the area. Speed and cunning are more important than brute strength. Attempt a direct assault on a
Military Base in an Imperial Courier and you won&#39;t last five minutes, but the same mission can be
completed in Ramon&#39;s Adder MkII, with a bit of cunning and lateral thinking! Crude e-bombing may
also prove fatal. A surgical strike is often required!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known Bugs &amp; Bug Reporting
--------------------------

MtKlima has completed the OXP on the Mac and TGHC has completed it on the PC, so this version
should be bug free!

Please post Bug Reports, questions or comments under:-

Expansion Pack - The Assassins Guild OXP (Final Updated version).

If you post a bug, could you check your save file and tell me how many kills you have and
what the values for the following variables are reading:-

&quot;mission_assassins_STAGE&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_killcount&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_jumpcount&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_gotscan&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_bugattack&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_robotescape&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_robottimer&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_navybots&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_war&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_unlocked&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_basedeath&quot;

(you can do this by opening your save-file with a text editor and using &quot;find&quot;. Once &quot;find&quot; is
up, type in assassins and it should jump you to all the assassins variables.)

As the script is very complex, (at a rough guess I think the beast has over 1000 commands!) it 
will make it a lot easier for me to squash any bugs if I know where you are in the OXP&#39;s script!

NB : If you haven&#39;t had a mission for a while, remember that missions depend not just on your
Guild Rating but also on your Elite rating. The Guild won&#39;t give the job of hitting a
Triad Supergrass (for example) to an &quot;Average&quot; Commander, nor will they give the mission
to an &quot;Elite&quot; Commander who only holds a &quot;Cut-throat&quot; rating with the Guild! You can&#39;t miss
anything though. Sooner or later you will hold high enough ranks in both rating systems and
you will be offered the next mission. Even if you meet all the conditions though, you will
only be offered the mission when you are in Galaxy 7.

Bug1 - Possible Death_Actions Bug
---------------------------------

There is a really small chance, that an NPC will kill a &quot;mark&quot; before you get to him.
This is very very unlikely, but the way Oolite is currently designed, it is possible that you
will be congratulated for killing a mark, when in fact an NPC did the deed. There is no
work-round at the moment, but the Characters in this OXP are pretty tough and will make 
mince-meat out of most pirates. I think they&#39;ll be safe until you find them! (I have
playtested every stage loads of times whilst developing and never hit this bug - although TGHC
hit it in playtesting one stage, but I think he was the only one!)

If you see an escape pod bailing out, you don&#39;t need to kill the pod. (This is just the
pilot ejecting and leaving his passengers to their fate.) You will still need to destroy
the abandoned ship however, as that is where your mark(s) will be.

Bug2 - &quot;Hang&quot; at Esausve, Beatle, Geteve, Ateslete &amp; Estiri.
------------------------------------------------------------

This isn&#39;t really a bug, just a fact of life! At certain stages of the OXP these systems
will be packed with between 50 and over 200 extra OXP ships!

It takes Oolite a little time, after you emerge from hyperspace (or launch), to populate the
systems. My script has over 100 commands adding the ships, so it takes Oolite a while to do this.
The game is frozen both for the player and the NPCs whilst Oolite does all this.

Don&#39;t panic! The game hasn&#39;t crashed. Just wait 10 to 20 seconds after the jump whilst Oolite
gets on with adding the ships. Once the ships are added, the game runs normally. The Game
tends to &quot;stutter&quot; for a few seconds once your cross-hairs come up, but once Oolite has sorted
itself out and added the ships, the game runs normally.

There is no slowdown in play, just a &quot;Hang&quot; in emerging from Hyperspace or when launching at
these Systems. Just flip through a few issues of Universal Scientist whilst you wait!  

I could have added the ships slowly with STATUS_IN_FLIGHT, but this would have meant that 
although were was no delay in entering the system, play would be interrupted constantly as the
ships were added. I thought it was better to have to wait a bit entering the system, but have
no interruptions in the gameplay.

Sorry - Price of epic 200 ship plus multi-sided battles!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the spoiler warning is a list of all the missions, mission descriptions and ships added
by this OXP together with a list of mission_states, setting out what the OXP is meant to do.

This is meant to help other OXP Modders. If you read it as a player, it will give the game away!

This was my 1st OXP (although from a simple idea it became a bit of an Epic)!

Feedback is very welcome!

Developers Note
---------------

Systems Changed by this OXP
---------------------------

-) Orreedon - PN118

No missions are scripted here nor are any new planets added. However, this planet is
referred to in some of the mission briefings (a source of trainable deadly goats!) and so
for completeness the description is changed to fit the Assassins plot.

-) Zarausxe - PN184

As above, no missions are scripted here, nor are any new planets added. However, mission 3
involves a hit on the Zarausxian Zero-G Hockey Team, so the planet&#39;s description and inhabitants
are changed to fit the Assassins plot.

-) Sobeer - PN19

As above, no missions are scripted here, nor are any new planets added. However in the
missiontext, mention is made of somebody being sent a Sobeerian Cod (as a Mafia warning!), so
the planet description is changed to reflect this.

-) Esreates - PN100

As above, no missions are scripted here, nor are any new planets added. However, the
Esreatesian Triads feature in 3 of the missions (both as victims, Hit-Ships after the player
and as clients!) and are mentioned in one of the News Broadcasts. The description of the planet
is changed 4 times as the Triads fortunes rise and fall.

-) Qudior (181), Erdiares (20), Cemaer (171), Onarmla (185), Gregeso (65) &amp; Esleve (44)

No missions are scripted at these planets, but once the &quot;Haywire&quot; BattleBots escape from
their base at Ateslete, they infest all the planets within a 7 light year range over time.
A new planet is infested every 10 jumps, going in the order the planets appear above. Once a
planet is infested, its description is changed to add a reference to the presence of the &quot;mad&quot;
battlebots in the system. At an infested system, mad battlebots will appear near the witchspace
beacon / main station and 5 will be added to the general system ships (so could appear anywhere)!

1) Orramaor - PN73

A companion Planet is added along with a nearby Dodec Station.

Data Changed: The Description, techlevel, inhabitants, government &amp; productivity.

The Description is changed again following the destruction of Soin Classic Shipyards.
 
Mission1 is scripted in this system.

2) Esrire - PN107

A gas giant is added along with a nearby Dodec Station.

Data is changed: Description and inhabitants.

Mission2 is scripted at this system&#39;s main station.

3) Tiared - PN194

A large (twice the size of a normal planet) volcanic planet is added with a nearby Dodec Station.

Data is changed: Description and inhabitants.

Mission3 is scripted in this system.

4) Beatle - PN203

A moon is added along with a starship repair station. Near the station are lots of powered
down ships being repaired. 25 Hognose Tugs (Murg&#39;s Hognose but with dockingAI) are nearby,
docking or waiting to dock with the station. A powerful security force is on patrol. A Repair
Crew Transporter also pootles about near the station hailing the player with adverts for the
Station&#39;s services. The station also launches OXP ships to defend itself.

Data is changed: The Description, techlevel, government, inhabitants &amp; productivity.

Mission6 is scripted near the station orbiting the OXP moon.

5) Geteve - PN18

A large moon with an orbiting Special Branch Military Station is added. 3 Groups of 3 Special
Branch Mega Asps patrol the System at various points.

A Thargoid Invasion of this system takes place and Mission 7 is scripted near the Station
orbiting the OXP moon.

Once the player has seen the 4th NEWS broadcast, bugs will always be present in this system,
some attacking the OXP station, some attacking the Main Station. OXP Special Branch Asps will
be engaging them! Once the Navy finally get their act together and perfect their own version
of a Thargon, Military Drone Ships and BattleBotts will also be engaging the Thargoids!

Data is changed : government, economy &amp; inhabitants.

The Description is changed five times.

6) Ateslete - PN39

An ice world is added with a nearby &quot;Griff Robotics&quot; Station.

Mission 8 is scripted in the system&#39;s spacelanes.

The light levels of this system are turned up to 3 times the normal level. The mission features
Griff&#39;s &quot;Battlebot&quot; and &quot;Control Drone&quot; ships. His textures are really cool (so I didn&#39;t want
to mess with them) but they are quite dark. I turned up the light levels so that the player could
have a good look at them.

The Description is changed three times. Economy, inhabitants, government and tech-level are
also changed.

7) Ataneries - PN81

A large forest-covered planet is added, together with a nearby Dodec. Station.

Mission 10 is scripted near the Witchspace Beacon.

The planet&#39;s description is changed.

8) Quandixe - PN53

The Quandixeian Mafia feature in the OXP, providing the player with several contracts. A tropical
moon is added, together with a nearby dodec station. A Mafia Drugs ship with dockingAI is
added near the OXP station, together with 8 Wiseguy Sidewinders. &quot;Wiseguy Sidewinders&quot; are
also on patrol in the system. 4 Mafia Drugs ships are added halfway between the w/s beacon
and the main planet.

Mission 11 is scripted between the OXP moon and the Main Planet.

The Description and inhabitants of the planet are changed.

9) Estiri - PN 82

The light level is increased to three times the normal level (Giff&#39;s Areon Class Frigate,
ClusterBombs and Navy BattleBots feature in Mission 13). A water covered moon is added along with
a nearby Military Base. Whilst doing Mission 13 the base is surrounded by a mine field of
ClusterBombs. BattleBots &amp; Drone Control Ships are on patrol. 

Mission 13 is scripted near the OXP moon.

The Description is changed 3 times.

-) Angeriri - PN71

No changes are made to the system data itself.

Mission 14 (Go to the Rebel Outpost to get the Graviton Missile) is set in this system (by
adding the Rebel Outpost and enemy ships at the time of the mission).

Mission 15 (the text adventure) takes place when docked at the Rebel Outpost.

Mission 16 (deilver the Missile to the Main Station) also takes place in this system.

10) Eszausve - PN 13

A lot of changes are made to this System as it forms the background to the last 3 &quot;civil war&quot;
missions. Light levels are turned up to three times the normal level. Giff&#39;s Areon Class Frigate
makes appearances on the Rebel&#39;s side along with Rebels flying well equipped Sleezen Shipyards
Cobra III Njx ships. The Dictatorship side is kitted out with Ramon&#39;s Mongoose Fighters, Scorpion
Class Frigates, Daemon Class Cruisers &amp; Griff&#39;s Dreadnaught!

A rocky moon and two gas giants are added. Dodec Stations are added near the gas giants.

Civil war breaks out and so after the player has seen the 9th News Broadcast, Rebel Cobras and
Aeron Class Frigates battle Dictatorship Mongoose Fighters and Scorpion Class Frigates.

At the time of Mission 17, the Balrog Dreadnaught (which the player needs to destroy)
is added near the moon and the system is packed with even more battling Mongoose Fighters and
Rebel Cobras. Scorpion Frigates also attack the player. 

At the time of Mission 18, the system is filled with battling Mongoose Fighters, Scorpion
Frigates, Daemon Class Cruisers, Rebel Cobras &amp; Rebel Aeron Class Frigates. 

At the time of Mission 19, a large asteroid Field is added together with the Dictator&#39;s Flagship,
Daemon Class Cruisers, Scorpion Frigates and Mongoose Fighters.

As the war variable moves from 1 to 5, different battling groups of Rebel and Dictatorship craft
are added to the system&#39;s ships. When the variable reaches 5, the rebels have won the war (not
without more than a little help from the player!) and so Giff&#39;s Frigates and Sleezens&#39;s Cobras
patrol the system unopposed! 

The System Data is changed as followed:-

Description	:	7 times.
Inhabitants	:	3 times.
Government	:	2 times.

Ship Roles
----------

The Script also calls upon ships with specific roles at various points in the OXP. The new
roles are:-

victim1, victim2, escort1, revenge1, revenge1a, revenge1t, revenge1tt, revenge2, bigbang,
beatlestat, powerdown, stugger, repairdef, repairfighter, guard, guard2, repairhit victim3,
sbstat, sbfighter, victim4, newbug1, newbug2, newbug3, antibug1, antibug2, policeasp, statbott,
victim5, madbattlebot, madbattlebot2, revenge3, revenge3t, victim6, crazy, navybot1, navybot2,
navybot3, navydrone, navydrone2, mafiastat, mafiafighter, mafiapatrol, mafiaguard, drugs, drugs2,
drugs3, weaktriad, hardtriad, victim7, triad1, revenge4, nbstat, nbfighter, clusterbomb,
minesweeper, minesweeper2, guarddrone, guardbot, victim8, hotel1, hotel2, xyzstat, ecop, imperial,
erebel, derebel, dimperial, dwarimp, dfrigate, rebelhermit, rebrock, gone, victim9,
imperial2, impjam, pdrone, imperial3, warfrigate, warimp, imperial4, fleet, fleet2, fleet3,
victim10, epatrol1, epatrol2, unlocked1, unlocked2, unlocked3, unlocked4, unlocked5, unlocked6,
unlocked7, unlocked8, unlocked9, unlocked10, unlocked11 &amp; nosuchship.

Nosuchship is not really a ship. This is just used as a wheeze to make the jump_count work.
Every time the player makes a hyperspace jump, the script checks to see if there are any ships
with the role nosuchship in the system. When it does not find any it increases the variable
mission_assassins_jumpcount by one. This allows the OXP to count the number of jumps the player
has made. This is used to space out the missions and stop them triggering as soon as kill count
is met. When a mission is completed the counter is set to zero. The next mission won&#39;t be offered
until the player has a certain kill count and has made a certain number of jumps. The problem
with just using kill count was that the player who installed with a lot of kills, would press
space and immediately the next assassins event would occur. The jumpcount gets round this. This
means a player who meets the killcount still has to wait a bit before the next mission hits. This
delay is also used when I want to create the impression of time passing between events, for
example, delays between the News Broadcasts. A similar variable to measure time is used to
control how far the infestation of the &quot;haywire Battlebots&quot; has spread, after they escape!

Please don&#39;t call any of your ships &quot;nosuchship&quot; or you&#39;ll mess up my jump counters!

Mission Variables
-----------------

The OXP uses 12 variables:-

&quot;mission_assassins_STAGE&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_killcount&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_jumpcount&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_gotscan&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_bugattack&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_robotescape&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_robottimer&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_navybots&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_war&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_basedeath&quot;
&quot;mission_assassins_unlocked&quot;

STAGE is used to check which mission the player is on and which missions have been completed.

killcount to used to check the number of Triad Hit-Ships the player has destroyed.

jumpcount is used to count the number of hyperspace jumps the player has made.

gotscan is used to check if the player has obtained the &quot;Mark Transponder Scanner&quot; from the
Assassins Guild (without which he cannot tell a victim in an Adder from any other Adder). This
item cannot be bought. If it happened to be destroyed the player could not replace it. The Script
checks the item is present. If it isn&#39;t and the player had previously obtained it, the script
reawards it. It comes with micro-bots to quickly reassemble any damaged parts! The Scanner is
also &quot;unplugable&quot; (like the Cloaking Device). Once you have it, when you buy a new ship, the
device transfers to the new ship.

bugattack is used to check if Geteve is under Thargoid attack. At the start of the OXP it is not.
After the player has seen the 4th G7 News Broadcast, Thargoids attack both stations and roam the
system. Special Branch Asps battle them. This forms the background to mission 7, but the Thargoid
invasion of the System remains a permanent feature. If you have Heretic&#39;s new Thargoids.OXP in,
then they will be attacking the main station. Otherwise it will be attacked by normal Thargoids.

robotescape is use to check if the haywire battlebots have escaped. At the start of the OXP
they have not, but at a certain point they break out and start causing havoc in one system.

robottimer is used to measure the spread of the battlebot infestation once they have escaped.
Once the 1st mission relating to the bots is completed, this variable is increased every time the
player makes a jump. Every 10 jumps a new system becomes infested. The bots spread from the
system in which they escaped and will eventually infest all the systems within 7 light years of
their starting point. I haven&#39;t let them go any further. But if somebody else wants to pick up
this plot thread...

navybots is used to check whether the perfected version of the BattleBots has been developed. At
the start of the OXP the Navy are still working on them (and the first version goes haywire).
At a certain point in the OXP, the player will see a News Broadcast announcing the deployment
of the BattleBots against the Thargoids attacking Geteve. At this point the variable is set to 1
and the player will see Navy Bots and Navy Drone Ships joining in the defense of Geteve. From now
on they will also be giving the Bugs a hardtime in witchspace (and I script for more Bugs to
appear as well), so the odds of Navy v Bugs is pretty fair. Best played with Behemoth.oxp and
ThorgonThreat.oxp installed! 

war is used to check if civil war has broken out at Eszausve. The civil war forms the background
to the last 3 missions of the OXP, but once war breaks out, groups of Dictatorship Mongoose
fighters, Scorpion Frigates and Daemon Class Cruisers battle Rebel Cobras and Rebel Areon Class
Frigates near the witchspace beacon, the main station and the OXP moon. None of these ships are
a threat to the player unless he decides to take sides!

basedeath is used to check if the player has blow up the Repair Facility.

unlocked is used when the OXP is completed, to unlock some of the OXP ships. Once unlocked, there
is a small chance of them appearing as pirates, traders, police ships and Military Ships.

Plea to other OXP builders!
---------------------------

If you are writing a mission, could you not set it in G7 (3, 6 and 8 are still blank!), that
way there will be no chance of my OXP clashing with yours. If you really must set it in G7,
then could you not script events at, or change the planet descriptions of, the above planets.

If you are a ship builder, could you avoid giving any of your ships the same role or name as
any of mine. I hope I picked unusual enough names so this will not be a problem.

List of Missions, Briefing Screens, Mission Descriptions &amp; Ships
----------------------------------------------------------------

Missions (stage at which they are offered - ONLY WHILST IN G7) :-

1) 	Kill Be Soin (200C)
	(be docked at any main station in G7 and have 200+ kills)

2) 	Report to the Guildmaster at Esrire to gain membership of the Guild.
	(complete mission1 and be docked)

-)	1st G7 News broadcast appears.

	(have 824+ kills, complete mission 3, still be in G7, player must have made at least
	5 hyperspace jumps since being paid for killing the Hockey Team and be docked.)

	Once this mission triggers, there is a 50% chance of being attacked by a group of

	there is a 50% chance on every jump of being ambushed by Inno Soin.

	At every single launching and hyperspace jump 3 Soin Clan Sisters will attack!

	Killing Inno Soin will complete the mission, but he will also spawn a &quot;Nova Device&quot;
	weapon. The Sun will start to go nova after his death! Better have enough
	fuel to get out of dodge! You will be far enough away so that it will take 20 odd
	seconds for the expanding sun to reach you, so you can Hyperspace out!

	Despite the number of Minesweepers in the area, if you manage to get a q-mine off (is
	possible if you are cleaver) in such a way that the Station is destroyed. This triggers
	a hidden feature, the description is changed and as long as you are in Galaxy 7, there
	is a chance of being attacked by vengefull Kraits!

-)	2nd G7 News broadcast appears.
	(complete mission6, have 1,200 kills, made at least 5 hyperspace jumps since being paid
        for destroying the Fair Wind &amp; be docked)

-)	3rd G7 News broadcast appears.
	(see the second G7 News broadcast, have 1,250 kills, made at least 2 jumps since seeing
        the 2nd G7 News Broadcast &amp; be docked)

-)	4th G7 News broadcast appears.
	(Must have made at least 5 hyperspace jumps since seeing the 3rd Broadcast &amp; be docked)

	Once this Broadcast is seen, Geteve will permanently be the subject of a Thargoid
	invasion. Bugs will attack both the OXP station and the Main station. How dangerous they
	will be depends on whether you have Heretic�s new Thargoid OXP installed! The bug-attack
	will form the backdrop to the next hit, but the Bugs will always now be present in the
 	system!

7)	Offered the contract to kill Inspector Thorstan (40,000C)
	(see the fourth G7 News broadcast, have 1,300 kills, made at least 10 jumps since
	seeing the 4th Broadcast and be docked.)

-)	5th G7 New broadcast appears.
	(Complete mission 7, have 1,600+ kills, make at least 6 jumps since being paid for
	killing Inspector Thorstan and be docked).

	A lot of traders are being killed in a mega-safe system. GalCop maintains that this
	is due to pirates, but is it really? Could it be that actually the Navy was working
	on their own version of a Thargon and these Battlebots have gone haywire?

8)	Offered the contract to destroy the Haywire Battlebot Control Drone (60,000C)
	(triggers as soon as the player has seen the 5th News Broadcast and docks at a main
	station after making at least 1 hyperspace jump).

-)	Haywire BattleBot infestation. (Complete and be paid for Mission 8 - then triggers)

	Once the player has been paid for completing mission 8, the haywire BattleBotts will
	start infesting all the systems within 7 ly of Ateslete, over time. Every 10 jumps the
 	player makes, another system is infested. The Bots infest in the order of Qudior,
	Erdiares, Cemaer, Onarmala, Gegeso &amp; Esleve. (so it will take 60 jumps before all the
        systems within 7 light years of Ateslete are infested). Whenever a system is
        infested, its description is changed to add a comment relating to the presence of the
	haywire battlebots (in addition to the system&#39;s normal description). In an infested
        system, 3 haywire battlebots will be at the witchspace beacon 5 will be added to
	the general system ships, 1 is added near the Main station.  

-)	6th G7 News broadcast appears.
	(complete mission 8, have 1,900+ kills, have made at least 7 jumps since being paid
	for the last hit and be docked).

9)	Defend yourself from irate Zero-G Hockey Fans! (no payment!)
	(Triggers immediately once the player has seen the 6th News Broadcast).

	During this phase of the OXP, there is a 50% chance of being attacked by vengeful
	Hockey Fans in Nemesis ships at every jump and launching. The chance of being
	attacked continues until the player has made at least 10 jumps, killed at least
        one Hockey Fan and is docked.
	
10)	Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves! : Duel Guild Sister O-Ren Ishii (5,000C)
	(Kill at least 1 Hockey Fan, make at least 10 jumps since seeing the 6th News Broadcast
	and be docked).

	There is no payment from the Guild for this mission. This is a matter of honor!
	However, O-Ren Ishii is a fugitive with a GalCop Bounty of 5,000C. Her Crazy 88
	squadron ships carry 200 C bounties.

--)	7th G7 News broadcast appears.
	(have 2,000+ kills, complete mission 10, make at least 10 jumps since being congratulated
	on winning the duel and be docked.)

	The Navy have finally got their battlebots working! Drone Ships and BattleBots are
	fighting the Thargoids attacking Geteve. From now on if the player decides to go to
	Geteve, he will be able to see Giff&#39;s Navy BattleBots in action! They will also from
	now on appear in witchspace, together with more Thargoids to keep the power balance!

--)	8th G7 News broadcast appears.
	(Make at least 10 jumps since seeing the last news broadcast and be docked).

11)	Protect the Mafia&#39;s Drugs Transport Ships &amp; Whack Triad Boss Yankisona (75,000C)
	(have 2,100+ kills, made at least 10 jumps since seeing the last news broadcast and be
	docked.)

12)	Defend yourself from the Triad Hit Ships
	(triggers immediately upon being paid for completing mission 11)

        Completing Mission 11, sets the Mission State to STAGE9 and sets the mission variable
        &quot;mission_assassins_killcount&quot; to zero.

        Once the mission state is at STAGE9, the Script adds a 50% chance of being ambushed upon
        exiting witchspace or launching by a Triad Hit-Ship. Each time you kill a Triad Hit-Ship,
	its death_actions advance the kill count by 1.

        Once the killcount is greater than 2 (ie you have killed 3 or more Triad Hit-Ships)
        and at least 5 jumps have been made, the 9th G7 News broadcast will be displayed at
 	the next docking.

--)	9th G7 News Broadcast appears.
	(triggers immediately upon docking once at least 3 Triad Hit-Ships have been killed and
	the player has made at least 5 jumps)

	G7 News reports that the Triad Boss and most of his henchmen have been arrested and are
	due to stand trial soon. You will no longer be attacked by Triad hit-ships.

13)	Hit the Triad Supergrass Bi Xea&#39;nu. (80,000C and Triad pardon!)
	(See the 9th G7 News Broadcast, make at least 1 hyperspace jump and be docked).

--)	10th G7 News Broadcast Appears. (CHANGED FROM B7)
	(complete mission 13, have 2,400+ kills, make at least 10 jumps since being paid for the
	witness hit and be docked).

	Once this broadcast is seen, groups of battling rebel and Dictatorship ships are
	added to Eszausve near the witchspace beacon and the moon. No Main Station is present
	in the System at this Stage of the OXP. (GalCOp is out of there!)

14)	Collect the Graviton Missile from the Rebel Outpost at Angeriri. (no payment) (NEW TO V1)
	(Make at least 15 jumps since seeing the 10th News Broadcast, have 2,600 kills and
	be docked.).

	The player is asked by the Rebels to collect a special Missile from a Rebel Outpost
	in the Angeriri. At Angeriri the player is attacked by Dictatorship Fighters. These
	ships are equiped with both Cloak Jammers and Hyperspace Jammers!

	If the Player survives the attack and docks at the Rebel Outpost, the next stage of
	the mission is triggered.

15)	Explore the Outpost on foot and reactivate Main Power (no payment) (NEW TO V1)
	(Must be docked at the Rebel Outpost at Angeriri).

	This places the player in a retro Text Adventure (using the mission Screen)!
	There are 2 objects to collect and 22 locations to explore. When the text adventure is
	solved the player recives a message asking him to dock at the current systems
 	Main Station, with a payload of Graviton Missiles. These Missiles can only be obtained
	from the F3 screen of the Rebel Outpost.

	The Outpost will however blow up once the player launches, so he&#39;d better remeber to
	tool up with Graviton Missiles, otherwise he won&#39;t be able to do Mission 17!

16)	Deliver the Graviton Missiles to the GalCop Main Station (no payment) (NEW TO V1).
	(Triggers as soon as the player has completed the Text Adventure).

	This mission is very easy!

	All the player must do to complete it is dock at the Main Station at the planet!

	The next mission brief is given once he arrives there. This mission is inserted
	really just to allow the player the chance to save having completed Missions 14 and
	15. As these take place at an OXP station, the Player cannot save until he is at a
	Main Station. This allows the player to save before he takes on the Dreadnaught!

17)	Destroy the Eszausveian Dreadnaught (90,000C) (NEW TO V1)
  	(Complete the Text Adventure and be docked at the Main Station at Angeriri.)

18)	The Battle for Eszausve : Part I
	(Triggers immediately upon being paid for mission 17)

	This is more a phase than a mission. The final mission will not trigger until
	the player has seen the 11th G7 News broadcast. This phase just sets the scene and gives
 	the feeling of the battles being an ongoing war, in which the player plays his part.

	In this phase :-

	The fighting between the Rebels and Dictatorships continues. This time the advantage
	is with the Rebels. Dictatorship Scorpions and Rebel Frigates also appear.	
	
	There is a 25% chance on any jump of being attacked at the w/s beacon by a group
	of Mongoose Fighters or Scorpions.

--)	11th G7 News Broadcast Appears.
	(have 3,000+ kills and have made at least 15 hyperspace jumps since being paid
        for destroying the Dreadnaught)

--)	The Battle for Eszausve : Part II
	(triggers immediately upon seeing the 11th G7 News Broadcast) (NEW TO V1)

	The battle at Eszauseve continues, although now the rebels are getting a kicking from
	Daemon Class Cruisers. The chance of the player being attacked continues, although now
	he will be attacked by Plasma Sentry Ships if the chance hits.	

19)	Final Mission : Assassinate Governor Tarkin. (100,000C)
	(have 3,000+ kills and made at least 10 hyperspace jumps since seeing the 11th
	G7 News Broadcast).

	The Rebels and Dictatorship craft are fighting battles in the Planet&#39;s air space (ie
	they are out of the Ooniverse), but a huge fleet of Dictatorship craft, with the
	Dictator&#39;s flagship leading from the rear, is coming in from deep space.

--)	12th and final G7 News Broadcast appears.
	(complete mission 16 and make 3 jumps since being paid and be docked).

	This is just a bit of fun, lets the player know that the OXP is completed and leaves
	a plot teaser (in case I do a follow-on)! G7 News reports that the Thargoids
	have withdrawn from Geteve. Now they have a bit of breathing space, Special Branch
	have investigated Inspector Thorstan&#39;s claims. They know the Guild really exists and
	they are determined to smash it....

	The bugs will now no longer be attacking Geteve. The mission state is set to &quot;COMPLETE&quot;
	and the variable _unlocked is set to 1.

	The OXP is completed, but the mad BattleBots will continue their infestation and some of
	the OXP ships now have a small chance of appearing in any Galaxy as traders, pirates and
	Police / Military Ships.

The OXP therefore gives out a total of 440,000 Credits. However, I estimate that the player will
have to spend about 100,000 Credits on repairs and weapons to complete the missions.

The missions are hard and will take at least 250 jumps to complete. It requires 170 jumps total
just to trigger all the phases, even if the player has sufficent kills! The player would actually
make more money in 100 jumps ferrying Computers / Furs between two safe systems in a python! 

It is assummed that the player is going about his ordinary Oolite buisness between missions, so
the cash is in addition to the money made trading / engaging in piracy / bounty-hunting. However,
most of the cash is given out for the last 3 very difficult hits. These hits are only offered to
a player with a Deadly rating, who therefore presumabley already has a large amount of cash in
the bank. The cash given out by Assassins shouldn&#39;t therefore enable a player to get his paws on
ships and equipment earlier than he would do normally.

Player Equipment List
---------------------

Coded as : EQ_MK_SCAN - &quot;Mark Transponder Scanner&quot;
Price : 1 credit. Only available at Techlevel 99 (ie it cannot be bought!).

In plot terms, this device is fitted to the players ship whilst he is undergoing
the Guild incitation ritual and allows him to identify Marked Commanders with his
targeting computer.

In Coding terms it does not actually do anything other than appear on the F5 screen, once
awarded by the OXP&#39;s script.

The reason the player can identify marks in coding terms is because the &lt;name&gt; of each
victim&#39;s ship starts with &quot;Guild Target : [name of mark] [contract value]&quot;

This item of equipment is really just added for &quot;realism&quot;!

Coded as : EQ_GRAV_MISSILE -&quot;Graviton Missile&quot;.

This missile can only be purchased at the Rebel Outpost after completing the Text Adventure.
As the Outpost is destroyed once the player leaves, the Missiles cannot be used in the game
generally. The missile has a massive weapon energy, capable of destroying any object in
the game. However, regardless of the target selected it will always home in on the Balrog
Class Dreadnaught. If no Dreadnaught is found, the missile just keeps heading forward and will
not detonate if it hits another ship or station. So although the missile is capable of destroying
stations it cannot be used for this purpose!

The missile is the only means of destroying the Dreadnaught (as it has energy of 50,000 and
a recharge rate of 100). The Missile has a scanner range of 5km and a maxium speed of 0.2LM.

The blast radius is large, so the player needs to deploy at close range and get away!

Player Ships (All use the same External Views)
----------------------------------------------

Vintage Adder
-------------

The same stats as Be Soin&#39;s Adder. The same as a normal Adder except:-

1) It has a retro wire-frame paint-job &amp; retro white laser beams.
2) It is fitted with a booster, taking its top speed to 0.30lm rather than the usual 0.24lm.
3) Unlike normal Adders, it may be offered for sale with additional equipment. (But the value
   of any extra equipment fitted is refelcted in the already inflated base price!)

On the downside:-

1) The base price (with no additional equipment) is 40,000 credits more than the normal Adder.
2) The booster completely fills the aft view with engine flames, making the aft view useless!

Nemesis
-------

The same stats as the Team Minders. The ship is similar to a Viper in combat performance
(although a bit better pitch, role &amp; recharge and packs 4 energy banks). This improved combat
performance comes at the price of only carrying two missiles, no cargo capacity and a base price
of 450,000 C. A pure combat ship for the rich bounty hunter who no longer needs to trade. Comes
with lots of flashing lights!


Mongoose
--------

The same stats as the NPC Mongoose Fighter. A one man light fighter: tiny, quite fast and nippy
but only has 1 energy bank, a forward laser mount, one missile and no cargo capacity. Also
as the ship is so small, very little equipment can be fitted. As the little fighter has wings,
the port and starboard views are rendered useless, as the player cannot see through the wings!
It is cheap though at 30,000 Credits and a Forward Military Laser comes as standard.


Mission Ships List:-
--------------------

1)  Coded ship name and role : Victim1 - &quot;Vintage Adder&quot;
    (&quot;Retro-Adder&quot; -  standard Adder but with a retro wire-frame paintjob and speed of 0.30lm)
    (Uses victim1AI - copy of normal trader AI, but has 8 new Ship Hails, so that
    Be Soin will plead / threaten you for his life as you attack him. Most ships
    in this OXP will hail you in their own unique fashion!)
    (Death Actions set the mission state to STAGE1a)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : &quot;Retro-Adder&quot; textured by Ramon.

2)  Coded ship name and role : victim2 - &quot;Guild Target : Hockey Team - 5,000C&quot;
    (&quot;Team Bus&quot; with ECM, Front &amp; Rear Beam laser, Shield Boosters)
    (Uses victim2AI - The same AI as the &quot;Minders&quot;, but with some pleading hails!)
    (Energy : 1,500 Recharge rate : 3.5, Speed : 0.32lm, Blue Lasers)
    (Has 4 &quot;Minders&quot; as escorts)
    (Death Actions set the mission state to STAGE2b)   

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : &quot;Team Bus&quot; modeled and textured by Ramon.   

3)  Coded ship name and role : escort1 - &quot;Team Minder : Nemesis&quot;
    (&quot;Minder&quot; with Front Military Laser &amp; ECM)
    (Energy : 300, Recharge : 5, Pitch / Roll : 2 / 3.2, Speed : 0.32lm)
    (Uses minderAI - The AI tells the minders to head to the planet along with the Team Bus
    unless they locate the player, in which case they attack.)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : &quot;Minder&quot; Modeled and textured by Ramon.

4)  Coded ship name and role : revenge1 - &quot;Soin Clan Sister : Mega Mamba&quot;
    (Modded Mamba, with Front Military Laser, fuel injectors &amp; ECM.)
    (Uses &quot;Revenge1.AI&quot; - a custom AI that scans for the player and attacks - never runs!)
    (AI causes it to issue you 11 comms message threats as it attacks you.)
    (Energy : 1,100, Recharge : 8, Pitch / Roll : 2/3, Speed : 0.45Lm, Orange Lasers)
    (Death Actions set the mission state to STAGE3b)

-)  Coded ship name and role : revenge1t - &quot;Soin Clan Sister : Mega Mamba&quot;
    (Exactly the same, but with a slightly different AI (revenge1tAI). This version sends
    a comms message threat when it locates the player. As 3 - 5 Sisters appear at once, every
    Sister doing this is too much! So one talkie sister is added. All versions will send comms
    messages when they die and when a missile is fired at them.)

-)  Coded ship name and role : revenge1a - &quot;Soin Clan Sister : Mega Mamba&quot;
    (Clone of ship 4, but without the death actions &amp; 10C Bounty). This is done for scripting
    reasons. Otherwise every time you killed a Sister whilst fighting Ship 5, the mission stage
    would go back a step, and the OXP could not be completed!)

-)  Coded ship name and role : revenge1tt - &quot;Soin Clan Sister : Mega Mamba&quot;
    (The same as revenge1a, but a talkie version!)

5)  Coded ship name and role : revenge2 - &quot;Inno Soin : Mega Fer-de-Lance&quot;
    (Modded Fer-de-Lance, Front &amp; Rear Military Laser, ECM, Fuel injectors, 100C Bounty)
    (Uses &quot;Revenge2.AI&quot; - same AI as for the Soin Sisters, but 7 new comms messages.)
    (Energy : 1,200, Recharge : 5, Pitch / Roll : 3/4, Speed : 0.35Lm, Cyan Lasers)
    (Death Actions set the mission state to STAGE3d)
    (Death Actions also spawn a &quot;bigbang&quot; and cause the sun to go nova!)

-)  Coded ship name and role : bigbang - &quot;Bomb 20&quot;
    This &quot;ship&quot; is purely for effect. In code, it is the death actions of revenge2, that
    cause the sun to go nova. Bigbang uses the qbomb model, and the BigbangAI just tells
    it to send the Comms message &quot;Let there be light&quot;, then perform tumble.
    This is simply to give the impression that it was the Nova Device that caused the sun
    to go Nova! In play terms, the player gets a comms message &quot;Bomb 20 : Let there be light!&quot;
    Then the sun goes Nova and he&#39;d better get out of dodge!	    

6)  Coded ship name and role : victim3 - &quot;Guild Target : The Fair Wind - 20,000C&quot;
    (Modded Anaconda - no weapons.)
    (Uses victim3AI - a nullAI but sends some pleading hails.)
    (Has the scanClass of a Rock - This ship is powered down).
    (Energy : 1,800, Recharge : 2)
    (Death_Actions set the mission State to STAGE4b)
    (Death_Actions also make the player a fugitive)

7)  Coded ship name and role : beatlestat - &quot;Augeaian Orbital Repair Facility&quot;
    (A clone of a dodec station except:-
    It has a new (very simple!) texture.
    Its beacon has the Letter R.
    It uses repairstationAI - this causes it to launch defenceships at the drop of a hat!
    It has 10 DefenceShips.
    Its DefenceShip is a Krait Interceptor - See below.)

    NEW TEXTURE BY LittleBear.

8)  Coded ship name and role : powerdown - &quot;{ship name} : Systems Shutdown&quot;
    There are five versions of this ship (Cobra III, Boa, Fer-de-Lance, Asp &amp; Adder)
    All have the same role. All are clones of the respective ship, save that all have
    buoyAI and the scan class of Rock. The Repair facility repairs ships, so a group of
    30 of these parked ships is added nearby.

9)  Coded ship name and role : stugger - &quot;Hognose Tugship&quot;
    (Murg&#39;s Hognose Tugship. No modifications, except that it has dockingAI)
    (25 of these ships are added near the repair yard. By giving them dockingAI the ships
    dock or hang about waiting to dock. They are given the role stugger, to prevent one
    of these ships being called by Murg&#39;s OXP as a normal tugship).

    GUEST SHIP : Hognose Tugship by Murgh.

10) Coded ship name and role : repaircrew - &quot;Repair Crew Transporter&quot;
    (A clone of a transporter - unarmed). 
    Uses repairAI. This was cribbed from Murg&#39;s addoidAI. The ship pootles about in the vicinity
    of the Station and hails the player with adverts for the station&#39;s services. (3 new Hails).

11) Coded ship name and role : repairdef - &quot;Augeas Security : Mega Krait&quot;
    (Modded Krait, Front &amp; Rear Military Lasers, ECM, has fuel injectors, blue Lasers)
    (Energy : 1,100, Recharge : 4, Pitch/Roll: 3/2, Speed : 0.45ml, 4 missiles, blue lasers)
    (Has the ScanClass of a police ship)
    (Uses planetpatrolAI)

    These ships (inspired by the Graveyard Kraits in the Dark Wheel), provide the security
    for the powered down ships undergoing repair.

--) Coded ship name and role : Guard - &quot;Augeas Security : Mega Krait&quot;
    (An exact copy of ship 11, but uses guardAI)
    (GuardAI causes the ship to hold station near victim3 until it finds the player.
    When it finds the player, it attacks - The security staff know what you are up to! This
    version of the ship only appears when making the hit on Victim3)

--) Coded ship name and role : Guard2 - &quot;Augeas Security : Krait Interceptor&quot;
    (A 3rd version, with much less energy - 200, but a blistering top speed of 0.65lm)
    (Used Guard2AI. Similar, but these ships patrol the space on the approach to the Station,
    so the AI is slightly different. - has 2 new hails. This version of the ship only appears
    when the player is making the hit on Victim3).

--) Coded ship name and role : repairfighter - &quot;Augeas Security : Krait Interceptor&quot;
    (This is the station&#39;s Defense Ship. Exactly the same as the above ship, but uses a
    different AI - repairfighterAI).

12) Coded ship name and role : sbstat - &quot;Special Branch Orbital Headquarters&quot;
    (Modded version of Giles&#39;s Military Station. Has yellow plasma, a smooth model, a more
    aggressive AI in terms of launching defense ships (sbstationAI), has 5 defense ships and
    it has the ship below - sbfighter as its defense-ship).

    GUEST SHIP : Military Station by Giles.

--) Coded Ship name and role : sbfighter - &quot;Special Branch : Mega Asp Mark III&quot;
    (&quot;Special Branch Asp&quot; - Front &amp; Rear Military Laser, ECM, Boosters &amp; Military Shield,
    fuel injectors)
    (uses sbfighterAI)
    (ScanClass of a police ship)
    (Energy : 1,400, Recharge : 6, Pitch/Roll : 2.5/3 Speed : 0.5lm, 6 missiles, yellow lasers)

    (This version of the Mega Asp is the Headquarters&#39; Defense Ship)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Textured by Ramon. (normal asp model with a new paint-job!)

13) Coded ship name and role : newbug1 - &quot;Thargoid Deathwreaker&quot;
    (A clone of the normal Oolite Thargoid Warship, but with it&#39;s stats boosted to match a
    special branch asp. 10 of these ships are added near the Special Branch HQ during the
    Thargoid Invasion of Geteve).
    (Uses newbug1AI. This AI causes the ships to attack the Special Branch Station and nothing
    else. The ships are not therefore a threat to the player, but they provoke the station into
    using its plasma turrets and launching defense ships, creating a scripted battle.)

--) Coded ship name and role : newbug2 - &quot;Thargoid Deathwreaker&quot;
    (Exactly the same, but this ship&#39;s AI causes it to attack the antibug1 asps).
    (Uses newbug2AI).

--) Coded ship name and role : newbug3 - &quot;Thargoid Deathwreaker&quot;
    (Exactly the same, but this ship&#39;s AI causes it to attack the player!).
    (Uses newbug3AI).

--) Coded ship name and role : antibug1 - &quot;Special Branch : Mega Asp Mark III&quot;
    (Exactly the same as the sbfighter, but this ship&#39;s AI causes it to attack newbug2 ships)
    (uses antibug1AI. 10 of these ships are added).

--) Coded ship name and role : antibug2 - &quot;Special Branch : Mega Asp Mark III&quot;
    (Exactly the same, but this ships AI causes it to hunt down any ship with the role Thargoid.)
    (uses antibug2AI. 10 of these ships are added near the main station to help the standard
    police ships deal with the 30 Thargoids nearby. In the unlikely event that the ship&#39;s AI does
    not find a target, it switches to route1patrolAI.).
    
14) Coded Ship name and role : victim4 - &quot;Guild Target : Inspector Thorstan - 40,000C&quot;
    (Exactly the same as the other Mega Asps, but no fuel injectors)
    (In playtesting, I found in its eagerness to attack, the ships AI often caused it to
    fuel injector into the station or other ships nearby, killing itself - and thus completing
    the mission! To stop this I toned down its speed).

    (Uses victim4AI - 8 new comms. hails. The mark will lurk by the station and will not get
    involved in the fight, as I don&#39;t want the bugs to do the players job! The bugs will not
    attack it as it has the role victim4. This is why I had to use all the different newbugs to
    create a battle rather than Thargoids. Particularly if the player has Heretic�s new Thargoids
    in, Thargoids would be quite likely to kill the mark before the player arrived. Once the
    AI finds the player, it will hail him, informing him that he recognizes him as a Guild 
    Member and then attacks. This ship only appears in Mission 7. 5 newbug3 ships are added
    near his position, so the player will have a fight on his hands).        
    
    (Death_Actions set the mission state to STAGE5d. The player will also become a fugitive
    as he has killed a police ship.)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Textured by Ramon. (normal asp model with a new paint-job!)

--) Coded Ship name and role : policeasp - &quot;Special Branch : Mega Asp Mark III&quot;
    (The same as all the other Mega Asp versions, but has route1patrol.AI.
    Small groups of these ships patrol Geteve)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Textured by Ramon.

--) Coded ship name and role : statbot - &quot;Griff Research Ltd Orbital Base&quot;
    (Clone of a Dodec station except for the name and its beacon has the letter G, also uses
    a smooth model)

15) Coded Ship name and role : victim5 - &quot;Guild Target : Control Drone - 60,000C&quot;
    (&quot;Control Drone&quot;, armed with 6 turrets and 2 Hardened Missiles, fuel injectors &amp; ECM)
    (uses victim5AI - stays where it is placed, until it finds the player, then attacks)
    (Energy : 1,260, Recharge : 3, Pitch/Roll : 0.5/0.5, Speed : 0.2lm, orange plasma)
    (Death Actions set the mission state to STAGE6b and spawn 5 &quot;mad battlebots&quot;)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model, Texture, AI and idea for the ship by Griff.

16) Coded ship name and role : madbattlebot - &quot;Malfunctioning BattleBot&quot;
    (&quot;BattleBot&quot;, armed with a front Beam laser and has fuel injectors.)
    (uses madbattlebot AI. This AI causes the bots to attack the player and nobody else.
    When on Energy Low, the bot transmits an error message. If the player now triggers an ECM
    burst, the bot will go to sleep! After 10 seconds it shuts down and becomes an uncontrolled
    Thargon. The bot can be scooped in this state. If shot at whilst asleep it wakes up and
    will attack. The bot has a pilot entry, so if scooped, Oolite will give the message &quot;You
    have captured a Malfunctioning Battlebot.&quot; On the Cargo Manifest though the bot shows up as
    Alien Items as I don&#39;t think there is a way to create a new item of cargo.)
    (Energy : 40 - but has destroyable subentries, so unless tackled head on the bots are quite
    tough! Recharge : 4.5, Pitch/Roll : 1/2, Speed : 0.38lm, bounty of 10C for killing but 250C
    for capturing, no missiles / cargo.)
    (Death actions spawn 2 bb1_splinters - see below)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model, Texture, AI and idea for the ship by Griff.

--) Coded ship name and role : madbattlebot2 - &quot;Malfunctioning BattleBot&quot;
    (Exactly the same as the above ship, but this version looks for traders, police and 
    pirates - in that order. If it finds no other targets then it will attack the player.)
    (Uses madbattlebot2AI) 

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model, Texture, AI and idea for the ship by Griff.

17) Coded ship name and role : bb1_splinter - &quot;Splinter Missile&quot;
    (&quot;BattleBot Splinter&quot; - basically a missile but with a new model &amp; texture)
    (Uses bb1_splinterAI - This is similar to missile AI, but with a different reaction to
    ECM. The splinters won&#39;t detonate, but ECM will cause them to go nuts and search for a new
    target. There is a 60% chance they will lock onto a battlebot or another splinter. There is
    still a 40% chance that they will keep coming at their original target. When spawned the
    splinters lock onto the nearest Merchantman. The player may therefore be targeted by a
    splinter from a bot killed by an NPC or may find that splinters from a bot he killed lock
    onto a nearby trader. Unlike a missile, you get no warning that a splinter has locked-on!)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model, Texture, AI and idea for the missile by Griff. 

--) Coded ship name and role : navybot1 - &quot;Navy BattleBot Mark I&quot;
    (Exactly the same as the madbattlebot, but has yellow lasers, police scan class, no
    bounty, a different pilot entry and does not spawn splinters when it dies. It has a different
    AI - Uses navybot1AI - This time the Navy got it right! Its AI causes it only to attack
    Thargoids. The Navy Bots only join the Battle at Geteve, some time after the player has
    completed the Drone Ship Mission and the Duel Mission. It took the Navy some time to get
    their design right! Once the Player sees the News Broadcast announcing the Deployment of
    the Navy Bots, if he goes to Geteve, he can see them in action against the Bugs!)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model, Texture, AI and idea for the ship by Griff.

18) Coded ship name and role : navybot2 - &quot;Navy BattleBot Mark II&quot;
    (&quot;BattleBot MkII&quot; - a different version of the battlebot with a different model, textures
    and subentries. Similar stats, but these battlebots are a little bigger and so pack a
    front Military Laser and carry an ECM. Their AI causes them to attack Thargoids, but in
    this improved version the &quot;bug&quot; that caused the first version to be sent to sleep by ECM
    is fixed. Uses navybot2AI and has police ScanClass. In this version the Bot will not
    spawn splinter missiles when it dies).

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model, Texture, AI and idea for the ship by Griff.

--) Coded ship name and role : navydrone - &quot;BattleBot Control Drone&quot;
    (The same as the victim5 ship, but spawns Military Bots when it dies. Uses navydroneAI.
    This causes it to look for and attack Thargoids. In the unlikely event it doesn�t find any,
    it heads for the planet).

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model, Texture and idea for the ship by Griff.

--) Coded ship name and role :navybot3 - &quot;Navy BattleBot Mark I&quot;
    (A clone, only the role is changed. This is because the script repopulates space near the
    main station with fallen bots and thargoids upon launching, if the bots near the station have
    been destroyed. The script therefore needs to be able to count the number of bots near the
    station as opposed to elsewhere in the system. To do this the Bots near the Station have to
    be given a different role.)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model, Texture and idea for the ship by Griff.

--) Coded ship name and role : navydrone2 - &quot;BattleBot Control Drone&quot;
    (A cone, the role changed for the same reason).

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model, Texture and idea for the ship by Griff.

--) Coded ship name and role : revenge3 - &quot;Irate Hockey Fan : Nemesis&quot;
    (Exactly the same as the &quot;Minders&quot; who escorted the &quot;Team Bus&quot;, but in this version the
    ship has revenge3AI. This is a killplayerAI with 8 hockey team threats! These ships appear
    in the interlude phase between seeing the 6th News Broadcast and being ordered to duel
    Guild Sister O-Ren Ishii). Death Actions set the Mission stage to 7a.

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : &quot;Minder&quot; Modeled and textured by Ramon.

--) Coded ship name and role : revenge3t - &quot;Irate Hockey Fan : Nemesis&quot;
    (Exactly the same, but uses revenge3tAI. This is the same AI, but sends a comms threat when
    it first finds the player. This is done for the same reasons as with the Soin Sister Ships.)

19) Coded ship name and role : victim6 - &quot;Guild Sister O-Ren Ishii : Hooded Cobra&quot; 	
    (&quot;Hooded Cobra&quot; - Ramon&#39;s Pirate Dark Wheel Cobra with boosted stats)
    (Front &amp; Rear Military lasers, ECM, Shield Boosters, Military Shield, Energy Unit,
    Fuel Injectors, 10 ton cargo capacity.)
    (uses victim6AI - kill playerAI with new hails.)
    (Energy : 1,800, Recharge : 3, Pitch/Roll : 2/3, Speed : 0.40lm. 2 ECM Hardened missiles,
    cyan lasers, bounty of 5,000C)
    (Death Actions set the mission state to STAGE7c)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Modeled and textured by Ramon.

--) Coded ship name and role : crazy - &quot;Crazy 88 : Mega Mamba&quot;
    (a clone of the Soin Sister&#39;s Mega Mamba, but with KillPlayerAI and a 200C bounty)

--) Coded ship name and role : mafiastat - &quot;Hesperides Wiseguy Way-Station&quot;
    (A clone of the normal dodec, but with a smooth model, the Beacon Q, has 30 Defense Ships
    - Mafiafighter and uses MafiastationAI, which makes it more aggressive in launching ships).

20) Coded ship name and role : mafiafighter - &quot;Wiseguy Sidewinder&quot;
    (Standard sidewinder - apart from the name - Front Military Laser &amp; ECM, Magenta Lasers)
    (Acts as the Mafia Station&#39;s Defense Ship - uses mafiafighterAI)
    (Has the ScanClass of a Police Ship - The Mafia run this system - Not GalCOP!!)

--) Coded ship name and role : mafiapatrol - &quot;Wiseguy Sidewinder&quot;
    (Exactly the same, but this version uses route2patrolAI)

--) Coded ship name and role : mafiaguard - &quot;Wiseguy Sidewinder&quot;
    (Exactly the same, but this version uses killtraidAI. This is done to create a scripted
    battle during Mission 11)

21) Coded ship name and role : drugs - &quot;Mafia Narcotics Transport : Anaconda&quot;
    (Modded Anaconda - Front &amp; Rear Beam Lasers, ECM, Cargo of 100 tons, likely Cargo of 10
    tons, all cargo is Narcotics.)
    (Energy : 800, Magenta Lasers, Police ScanClass)
    (In this version the drugs ship has dockingAI as it appears near the OXP station)
    (All versions of the Drugs ships will transmit a mafia-type threat when dying - 4 hails)

--) Coded ship name and role : drugs2 - &quot;Mafia Narcotics Transport : Anaconda&quot;
    (Exactly the same, but has route1traderAI as these ships appear halfway between the w/s
    beacon and the main planet).

--) Coded ship name and role : drugs3 - &quot;Mafia Narcotics Transport : Anaconda&quot;
    (Exactly the same, but has killtriadAI and with Energy of 200.
    These ships will attack the weaktriads. This is done to create a scripted battle during
    Mission 11. The low energy is given so that lots of plaintive hails appear during the
    triad / mafia battle that forms the backdrop to Mission 11).

22) Coded ship name and role : weaktriad - &quot;Triad : Gecko&quot;
    (A standard Gecko with a Front Military Laser and ECM, 10 Credit Bounty, Cyan Lasers).
    (There are two versions of this ship, one with an AI to attack the Drugs Ships and one
    with an AI to attack the Guards. These ships are used to create a scripted battle between
    the Mafia and the Triads during mission 11)

23) Coded ship name and role : hardtriad - &quot;Triad : Military Wasp EX-01&quot;
    (&quot;Wasp&quot; an experimental version of Ramon&#39;s Wasp, stolen from Marett shipyards by the Triads!)
    (Energy : 1,100, Recharge : 3, Pitch/Role 1.5/1.8, Bounty : 150, Speed : 0.4lm, ECM, Front &amp;
    rear Military Lasers, 4 missiles, cyan lasers)	    
    (Uses killdrugsAI. These ships only appear during Mission 11)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Modeled and textured by Ramon.

--) Coded ship name and role : triad1 - &quot;Triad : Military Wasp EX-01&quot;
    (Exactly the same as the hardtriad, but this version has holdkillplayerAI. This causes the
    ships to wait where they are spawned until they find the player. Then they attack!)
    
24) Coded ship name and role : victim7 - &quot;Guild Target : Boss Yankisona - 70,000C&quot;
    (&quot;PTSF 200-X3&quot;)
    (Front &amp; Rear Military Lasers, ECM, Shield Booster, has fuel injectors)
    (Energy: 1,500, Recharge : 4, Pitch/Roll :1.6/ 2.6, Speed : 0.4ml, 4 missiles, bounty 2,500C,
    Green Lasers).
    (Uses victim7AI - a holdkillplayerAI with appropriate triad boss hails - 5 new hails!)
    (Death Actions set the mission state to STAGE8b)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Modeled and textured by Wyvern.
    
--) Coded ship name and role : revenge4 - &quot;Triad : Military Wasp EX-01&quot;
    (This ship is a clone of the hardtriad ship, but also equipped with fuel injectors.
    The ship uses Revenge4AI. This is a killplayerAI with triad hails. The Death_Actions advance
    the mission variable &quot;mission_assassins_killcount&quot; by 1 and send a triad threat).

    For scripting, the ship therefore needs a different role from the standard Triad Wasp.

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Modeled and textured by Ramon.

--) Coded ship name and role : nbstat - &quot;Nemeanian Military Base&quot;
    (Exactly the same as the Special Branch Station, apart from the name, its beacon and that
    it has 30 nbfightes as defense ships).

25) Coded ship name and role : nbfighter - &quot;Navy Asp Mark II&quot;
    (A standard Oolite Asp, but fully equipped. Has yellow lasers, a smooth model and Police
    Scan Class.)

26) Coded ship name and role : clusterbomb - &quot;Navy Clusterbomb&quot;
    (&quot;Clusterbomb&quot;, no lasers, but holds 20 ECM hardened missiles, Police ScanClass)
    (Scanner range reduced to 10km, speed of zero, Energy : 2500, Recharge : 2)
    (Uses clusterbombAI)

    These devices are used as a mine-field surrounding the Military Base at the time of the hit
    on the Triad Supergrass. As the player approaches the Base, getting too close to a
    clusterbomb will cause it to lock on to him and fire ECM Hardened Missiles at him.

    The AI does not respond to being attacked in the usual way. I found that if I set them to
    set the attacker to a primary aggressor, Oolite would crash as if the player deployed an
    energy bomb, all the bombs on his scanner (30 odd) would spew missiles at him. Whilst cool,
    within seconds the scanner would be filled 200+ missiles and the game would lock.

    Instead, when attacked a bomb will go to look for targets. Most will not find the player due 
    to their low scanner range but the bombs already locked on will fire off even more missiles.

    The Bombs are tiny and the player is not really meant to engage them. The idea is that he
    carefully navigates the mine field to reach the point where the mark is. They have such a
    huge amount of energy to prevent the player getting rid of the mine field with an energy
    bomb. That would be no fun at all! The clusterbombs only appear when the base is closed to
    civilian traffic at the time of the hit on the Supergrass.

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model, Texture and idea for the bomb by Griff.

27) Coded ship name and role : minesweeper - &quot;Mine Sweeper Satellite&quot;
    (Model of Wombat&#39;s Thargoid Spy Satellite but with hatched panels, so it doesn&#39;t look
    Thargoidish.) Cannot be destroyed (Energy 50,000 and Recharge 100). Has no weapons and cannot
    move, Rock ScanClass (as it is unpowered), Scanner Range of 60km. Uses minesweeperAI.

    These Defense Satellites are placed by Military Bases to defend the base against attack by
    Q-Mines. When a mine is detected the Satellite�s dish transmits an EMP pulse at the Q-mine,
    frying its CPU and preventing it from detonating. In code this is done with the AI. The
    AI always remains in the Look for Targets state even if attacked. If it finds a Q-mine, it
    sends a comms message &quot;Firing EMP at Targeted Mine&quot; and performs a script action on
    the mine turning it into an uncontroledthargon. In play terms, the player&#39;s mine turns white
    on the scanner and fails to detonate.

    GUEST SHIP : Model by Wombat. (Used with permission).

--) Coded ship name and role : guarddrone - &quot;BattleBot Control Drone&quot;
    (The same as all the other Control Drones, but in this version, has holdkillplayerAI)

--) Coded ship name and role : guardbot - &quot;Navy BattleBot Mark II&quot;
    (The same as the other MkII BattleBots but has holdkillplayerAI)   

28) Coded ship name and role : victim8 - &quot;Guild Target : GSS Indefatigable - 80,000C&quot;
    (&quot;Aeron Class Frigate&quot; Front &amp; Rear Military Lasers, ECM, Military Shield &amp; shield boosters,
    fuel injectors, 4 ECM Hardened missiles)
    (Energy : 1,800, Recharge : 2, Pitch/Roll : 2/2 Speed : 0.55lm, Police ScanClass,
    Blue lasers, no cargo capacity)
    (Uses victim8AI - holdkillplayerAI with 7 new hails).
    (Death Actions set the mission State to STAGE10a).
    (Death Actions also make the player a fugitive with a 350C bounty).

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model and Texture by Griff.

--) Coded ship name and role : hotel1 - &quot;Deep Space Hoopy Hotel : Lernean Branch&quot;
    (The ship is a clone of a Dodec Station, except for the name and that it will show
    on the Space Compass with the Letter L).

--) Coded ship name and role : hotel2 - &quot;Deep Space Hoopy Hotel : Hades Branch&quot;
    (exactly the same except for the name and that its beacon has the Letter H)

--) Coded ship name and role : xyzstat - &quot;Dodecahedron Station&quot;
    (exactly the same except for the name and that its beacon has the Letter S)

    The hotels do not figure in any of the Assassins Missions. They just give the player a place
    to dock, should he chose to travel to either of the Gas Giants at Eszausve.

    This Dodec Clone is used at certain OXPed planets to add an extra station to an OXP planet
    if it does not already have a base which features in the Missions.

29) Coded ship name and role : imperial - &quot;Eszausveian Navy : Mongoose&quot;
    (&quot;Mongoose Fighter&quot;, Front Military Laser, 1 missile, Bounty : 10)
    (Energy : 64, Recharge : 2, Pitch/Roll : 2.1/3.2, speed : 0.32lm, green lasers)
    (Uses killrebelAI - attacks the rebels but will defend itself if attacked by another ship. If
    no targets are found it heads for the planet).

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : &quot;Mongoose&quot; modeled and textured by Ramon.

    These ships on their own are incredibly weedy. However, they are encountered in
    swarms of 10 to 30. They do not pose a direct threat to the player. This is a civil war
    between the Dictatorship and the Rebels.

--) Coded ship name and role : ecop - &quot;Eszausveian Navy : Mongoose&quot;
    (Cone of ship 29 but with police scan class and planetparolAI. These ships act as police
    patrols at Eszaisve before it is thown out of the Union of Worlds. (ie war = 0).

30) Coded ship name and role : erebel - &quot;Rebel : Cobra III NjX&quot;
    (fully equipped Sleezen&#39;s Cobra Njx, but no fuel injectors)
    (Used with Sleezen&#39;s permission but no mods except for adding &quot;Rebel :&quot; to the name)
    (Given 1 missile for this appearance. This is in order to get the two sides dog-fighting!)
    (Uses killimpAI - The same AI as the imperial fighter, but searching for imperials. In
    this version the rebel will send a comms message randomly selected from [erebel-chat]
    at certain states of its AI. This so it appears to the player that he is overhearing &quot;combat
    chatter&quot; and a chance for some Star Wars references!)

    GUEST SHIP : Cobra Njx by Sleezen.

--) Coded ship name and role : derebel / dimperial / dwarimp / dfrigate.
    All these ships are clones of the normal ones, used in the Dreadnuaght Mission with differnt
    AIs to create battles. Their death actions also repopulate space near the Dreadnaught, so
    that a battle is always raging at this position.

--) Coded ship name and role : rebelhermit - &quot;Rebel Outpost&quot;.
    (Clone of a rock hermit except for the name. Has the beacon R and a techlevel of 19).
    (This is to allow the player to be equipped with the Graviton Missile. The text adventure
    also takes place at this station).

--) Coded ship name and role : rebrock - &quot;Asteroid&quot;.
    (This &quot;ship&quot; is just used to destroy the Rebel Outpost when the player leaves. It uses the
    asteroid model, but acts like a missile trageted on the Rebel Outpost, using rebrockAI. On
    impact the asteroid release a large amount of weapon_energy blowing the Outpost up.)

--) Coded ship name and role : gone - &quot;If you are seeing this there&#39;s a bug in the OXP!!&quot;
    (clone of a nav beacon but with goneAI).

    This ship is a pure workaround! At one stage Galcop removes its station from Eszausve I
    therefore set the Main Station to gone. &quot;Gone&quot; explodes as soon as the player enters the
    system, so there is no Main Station in the System. If the Nav Beacon clone is allowed to
    live, wiredly Oolite treats it as the Main Station and it lauches ships!. You can also
    autodock with it and save the game. To avoid this it is destroyed as soon as it is spawned.

--) Coded ship name and role : warfrigate - &quot;Rebel : Aeron Class Frigate&quot;
    (The same as the above ship, but with the killimpAI)    

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model &amp; Texture by Griff.

31) Coded ship name and role : victim9 - &quot;Guild Target : Balrog Dreadnaught - 90,000C&quot;
    (&quot;Balrog Dreadnaught&quot;. Armed with 12 high power plasma turretts, Max Speed of 0.075LM,
    Pitch / Roll 1:1. No missiles, ECM. Cannot be destroyed by normal means as it has energy
    of 50,000 and recharge of 100. Only a Graviton Missile can destroy it!).

    Death Actions set the Mission Variable to STAGE11c.

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model &amp; Texture by Griff.

32) Coded ship name and role : imperial2 - &quot;Eszausveian Navy : Scorpion Frigate&quot;
    (Scorpion Frigate, Front Military Laser, Aft Thargoid Laser, ECM)
    (Energy : 1,800, Recharge : 5, Pitch/Roll : 1.2/2.4, Speed : 0.40lm, Cargo of 5 tones, all
    firearms, 2 missiles, green lasers, 200C bounty).

    In this version, uses holdkillplayerAI.

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : modeled and textured by Ramon.

--) Coded ship name and role : impjam - &quot;Eszausveian Navy : Scorpion Frigate&quot;
    (Clone of the above ship, but has a top speed of 0.6LM. Uses impjamAI to send the player a
    message jamming his cloak and hyperspace capacity. The removal of these functions is done
    in script!)

--) Coded ship name and role : warimp - &quot;Eszausveian Navy : Scorpion Frigate&quot;
    (The same as imperial2, but with killrebelAI)

--) Coded ship name and role : imperial3 - &quot;Eszausveian Navy : Mongoose&quot;
    (The same as the other mongoose fighters, but with killplayerAI).

33) Coded ship name and role : imperial4 - &quot;Eszausveian Navy : Daemon Class Cruiser&quot;
    (Daemon Class Cruiser, 4 plasma turrets, Front and rear Thargoid lasers, port and starboard
    Military Lasers, ECM, 12 ECM Hardened Missiles, 1000C bounty.)
    (Energy : 2250, Recharge : 4, Pitch/Roll : 0.2/0.4, Speed : 0.32lm, Cargo of 10 tones,
    green lasers and plasma).
    (Uses killrebelAI)

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : modeled and textured by Ramon.

34) Coded Ship name and role : pdrone - &quot;Plasma Sentry Drone&quot;
    (&quot;Sentry Drone&quot;. Speed : 0.75LM, Energy : 75, Pitch / Role 2 : 2. Armed with a single plasma
    turret. Uses a killplayerAI).

    NEW SHIP GRAPHICS : Model &amp; Texture by Griff

--) Coded ship name and role : fleet - &quot;Eszausveian Navy : Daemon Class Cruiser&quot;
    (The same as the above ship, but uses fleetAI. The Main fleet is added in deep space at
    the time of the final mission. The AI searches for the player, but if it finds no target
    heads for the planet. At first none of the ships in the fleet will find the player, so
    start moving from their stating co-ordinates to the planet. As all have the same AI, the
    Groups of ships which make up the fleet stay together. The final mark - who has a beacon
    is leading the fleet from the rear. The player therefore has to fly through several
    groups of hostile ships to reach the target, or cunningly over-fly and hit frm the rear!)

--) Coded ship name and role : fleet2 - &quot;Eszausveian Navy : Mongoose&quot;
    (The same as the other mongoose fighters, but with fleetAI).

--) Coded ship name and role : fleet3 - &quot;Eszausveian Navy : Scorpion Frigate&quot;
    (The same as the other Scorpions, but with fleetAI. In this version speed is reduced to
    0.32 lm in order to keep the fleet together.)

--) Coded ship name and role : victim10 - &quot;Guild Target : ESS Defiant - 100,000C&quot;
    (The same as the Daemon Class Cruisers apart from the name. Has a beacon with the letter
    T and uses victim10AI. This AI is the same as the fleetAI, but sends the player threats.)    
    (Death Actions set the Mission Stage to STAGE14)

--) Coded ship name and role : epatrol1 - &quot;GalCop : Cobra III NjX&quot;
    (The same as the other rebel Cobras, but has police Scan Class and hitspatrolAI. These
    ships appear at Eszausve once the war is won and the former Rebels are the Official
    Government. The AI causes the ship to patrol looking for pirates and thargoids.)

--) Coded ship name and role : epatrol2 - &quot;GalCop : Aeron Class Frigate&quot;
    (The same as the normal Aeron Class Frigate with the same mods as made to the erebel.)

Special Unlocked Ships
----------------------

Once the player completes all the missions and sees the final News Broadcast, there is a small
chance of seeing some of the OXP ships appearing in any Galaxy as traders, pirates and police /
Military Ships. In all cases the ships are clones of the Mission Ship, but with a different
name, AI and have no death_actions.

Seeing the last Broadcast sets the variable &quot;unlocked&quot; to 1. The script will add an unlocked
ship(s) to a certain point in any system, if the dice hit and the player is exiting hyperspace.

Each unlocked ship only has a 1% chance of appearing. However as there are 11 unlocked ships,
there is an 11% chance of an unlocked ship appearing. Even if the ship appears, most of the ships
just get on with doing their own thing and are only added at certain points in the system.

It is quite likely that even if the dice pick the chance of an unlocked ship appearing, the
player will not encounter it. Seeing an unlocked ship once completing Assassins, should therefore
be a rare surprise!

Ship Role	:	Unlocked1  (Vintage Adder)

A clone of the Victim1 ship, but with route1traderAI. 3 are added within 10km of the Co-ordinates

OXP Technical Information - List of mission states
--------------------------------------------------

When first installed, the mission status will be - &quot;mission_assassins_undefined&quot;.

As soon as the OXP is installed, the planetinfo.plist adds the moons, extra planets, gas
giants to the OXPed Systems listed above. The Script adds all the OXP stations and ships
normally present. Other ships are only added for particular missions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission status	: UNDEFINED

If you are docked at a Main Station,
AND you are in G7
AND you have 200+ kills THEN:-

You will receive the INCOMING MESSAGE (Hitbrief_1).

If you installed the OXP with less than 200 kills or you were not in G7, then this
message will appear the first time you dock in G7 with 200+ kills.

If the commander you loaded after you installed is both in G7 and has 200+ kills,
then give Oolite 30 seconds or so and the message should pop up.

The message is from the Assassins Guild and offers you the sum of 200 Credits, if
you are prepared to kill Be Soin (flying an original Bell &amp; Braben Shipyards Adder)
in the Orramaor System.

The mission state is set to assassins_STAGE1
Your mission text on F5 screen should read &quot;Ensure Be Soin and enjoys a
happy retirement in the Orramaor System.&quot; (assassins_header1).
The Planet Orramaor is also marked on the local and Galactic map.

The System Data for the OXPed planets is altered.

Other Planet Descriptions are changed later on, some several times, as the actions of the player
(and other characters) change the Ooniverse. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission status	: STAGE1

You&#39;ve seen the message and pressed space.

If you never go to Orramaor (Planet 73) then nothing further will happen.

(It is your choice whether or not to embark on a life of crime!)

If you do, the OXP ship VICTIM1 will be added to the ships in the system.
(See above for the ships list for victim1&#39;s specs)

Victim1 (Be Soin) is added at the Co-Ordinates : pwm -10185 3691 441492.

VICTIM1 is a standard adder with a new retro paintjob. When you target him, he appears as
&quot;Vintage Adder&quot;. He&#39;s the only Commander flying such a retro ship in the system, so you&#39;ll
have no problem identifying your mark!

If you let him live, the OXP will not advance any further.

If you are very slow in heading towards victim1&#39;s position, he may reach his holiday destination
and dock with the station near the OXP planet! However he will now always be in the system, so
if you miss him, hyperspace out of the system and then jump back in and have another go!

It is virtually impossible to fail the mission however! The adder is very slow and his AI causes
him to pootle along at half speed. This mission is really a scene-setter. The proper missions
only start when you gain membership of the Guild.

Assuming you terminate him, the death_actions of victim1 will set the mission
state to assissins_STAGE1a

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Missions status	: STAGE1a

Be Soin is dead.

Nothing will happen until you dock.

The next time you are docked at a Main Station (not rock hermits or carriers),
you will get a message from the Assassins Guild (hitsbrief_1a)

Turns out the Guild just picked this innocent rodent out of the phone book, to test
how murderous you were!

They are impressed however with your cold-heartedness, and invite you to meet the Guildmaster
at Esrire (planet number 107). If you wish to join the Brotherhood (and endure the initiation
ritual), better get your iron ass 30 odd light years away to Esrire!

When you press space:-

Mission status will advance to STAGE1b
180 Credits are awarded (200 - minus the Guild&#39;s cut of 10%)
The mark on the maps for Orramaor is removed.
The planet Esrire (PN107) is now marked on the maps.
Mission text will change to &quot;Dare you report to Guildmaster Nua&#39;etou in the Esrire System?&quot;
(this is assassins_header2).

The OXP will do nothing further until you are docked at Esrire (planet number 107)

If you never go there, nothing further will happen!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission status : STAGE1b

IF the mission status is STAGE1b and you dock at Esrire, then a mission briefing will pop up
(hitsbrief_1b) explaining how you meet the Master and are inducted into the Brotherhood.

The Guild promises that they will contact you in due course.

Mission status will advance to STAGE1c
Mission text will change to &quot;The Assassins Guild ranks you as a Novice.&quot;
(this is assassins_header3).
The Mark Transponder Scanner is awarded (EQ_MK_SCAN).
The Jumpcount Variable is set to zero.
The gotscan variable is set to 1.
The mark on the maps for Esrire (PN107) are removed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission status : STAGE1c

Once at least 3 hyperspaces jumps have been made:-

A G7 News broadcast is displayed at the next docking at a main station. (hitsbrief_1c)

From the G7 News broadcast, looks like Be Soin had a Clan who fly Mega Serpent Class ships and
they&#39;re not happy about their uncle being rubbed out.

Don&#39;t panic though, they don&#39;t know who killed him. (yet!)

Once you press space, the mission state is set to STAGE2
The jumpcount variable is set to zero.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission status : STAGE2

The kill count must be 500+
Player must still be in Galaxy 7.
At least 6 hyperspace jumps must have been made since the player saw the G7 News broadcast.
And the player must be docked at a main station.

Once the conditions are satisfied a job for the Mafia to take out a sports team who failed
to throw a game will appear. (hit_brief2).

Once the player presses space:

mission state is set to assassins_STAGE2a

Mission description reads &quot;Arrange that an accident befalls the Zarausxian Hockey Team
in the Tiared System.&quot; (assassins_header4).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission status : STAGE2a

You&#39;ve pressed space. The OXP will do nothing further until you are at Tiared (PN 194).

Once you are at Tiared &quot;Victim2&quot; (plus 4 escorts), is added at the Co-Ordinates:-
pwm -1041 1917 284108

As the player was warned when he joined the Guild, he will not be able to use a Cloaking Device
whilst within one light-year of a mark. Cloaking breaks the Mark Transponder lock. The Guild
must have proof from the Mark Transponder Scanner that a victim has been terminated!

The script checks if a victim is present. If a victim is present (and the player has the
Cloaking Device) then the script removes it. Whilst in flight the script keeps checking for
the presence of a victim, as soon as none are found the cloaking device is awarded again
provided the player had it in the first place (ie he completed the cloaking device mission).
The cloaking device is also rewarded if the player makes a hyperspace jump to another system
(as long as the victim isn&#39;t there) and when he docks.

In game terms, the player finds that his cloak will not function when he is in the same system
as the victim. However, about 6 seconds after the victim dies, hyperspaces out or the player
hyperspaces out the cloak will work again.

I included this code to disable the cloak (and an explanation in plot terms by giving the player
the new scanner to identify victims) as the missions were way too easy if the player could
complete them cloaked. It may be that the ship I tested with (Imperial Courier with Naval and
standard energy units is a bit uber), but I found using the cloak takes all the challenge out of
Oolite. At least with the energy of my ship, I can stay cloaked almost indefinitely (and a few
seconds uncloaked regains enough energy to re-cloak). As NPC ships completely ignore a cloaked
ship, if I cloak I can destroy any ship, however many of them there are, without being damaged.

Obviously, Elite &amp; Oolite is all about the player having free choice. I haven&#39;t therefore taken
away the choice to use the cloak. The player is free to use the cloak at other times, he just
won&#39;t be able to when he engages the victims in the OXP. The player has the choice not to take
these missions. The same code is used to disable the cloak for all victims in the OXP.

The Guild doesn&#39;t care whether or not you kill the Minders (they are not the Mark). If you fail
to kill the Hockey Team, nothing further will happen.

Killing the Hockey Team will set the Mission Sate to : STAGE2b

This is done by victim2&#39;s death_actions (See the Shipdata file).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission status : STAGE2b

Nothing will happen until you dock.

As soon as you are docked, the briefing &quot;hitbrief_2a&quot; will appear. The Guild congratulates
you. You&#39;ve pleased the Mafia and also the losing finalists!

Once you press space:

4,500C are awarded (5,000 minus the Guild&#39;s 10%)
Mission description changes to &quot;The Assassins Guild ranks you a Cut-throat.&quot; (assassins_
header5).
The mark on the maps for Tiared is removed.
The jumpcount variable is reset to zero.
Mission state is set to assassins_STAGE3

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission status : STAGE3

If kills are 824+
And still in Galaxy 7
Jump count must be 5 or more.

Then the next time you dock &quot;Hitbrief3&quot; will appear.

Oh dear! The Soin Clan hacked the Guild&#39;s Computer. They know it was you who killed their
uncle. The Guild managed to arrange an accident which wiped out most of the Clan, but
the Clan leader and some of his sisters escaped! They&#39;ll be coming for you.

When you press space:-

Mission status will advance to STAGE3a
Mission description will read &quot;Defend yourself from the vengeance of Inno Soin and his sisters.&quot;
(assassins_header6).
The Planet Description of Orramaor (73) is altered again.
Jump Counter is reset to zero.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission status : STAGE3a

The Soin Sisters are after you!

Every time you make a hyperspace jump, there is a 50% chance of being ambushed by a gang of 5
&quot;Soin Clan Sister : Mega Mamba&quot; ships (ship revenge1). There is also a 50% chance of being
attacked by 5 Soin Clan Sisters every time you launch.

Killing any one of the Mega Mambas will (by it&#39;s death actions) set the mission state to 3b.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission status : STAGE3b

Must have killed at least 1 Soin Clan Sister AND made at least 5 hyperspace jumps.

The Chance of being attacked continues until you meet both conditions and dock at a main station.

Once both conditions are met, on the next docking:-

The mission brief (hitbrief_3a) will pop up.

Inno Soin is still out there. And he is flying a ship fitted with the dreaded Nova Device and
an anti-MASK cloak jammer!

Pressing Space:-

2,000 Credits are awarded
The mission state is set to STAGE3c
Mission description changes to &quot;Defend yourself from the vengeance of Inno Soin and the Nova
Device.&quot; (assassins_header7)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission State : STAGE 3c

Once the mission status is 3c, there is a 50% chance on every jump of being ambushed by
Inno Soin in a &quot;Mega Fer-de-Lance&quot; (revenge2). 3 Soin Clan sisters (revenge1a) will also 
attack on every hyperspace jump and every launch!

Killing Inno Soin will advance the mission stage to STAGE 3d. 

He will also however spawn a Nova Device (bigbang). The sun will start to go nova! You will be
far enough away so that it will take about 20 seconds for the blast to reach you, but don&#39;t hang
about with the H key - remember the 15 second countdown!

&quot;Bomb 20&quot; (the nova device) should also send you a Dark Star reference comms hail!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission State : STAGE 3d

Nothing further will happen until you dock.

Upon docking the mission brief (hitbrief_3b) will appear.

The Guild congratulates you and awards 5,000 credits in compensation. You are promised a
lucrative assignment soon.

Pressing Space:-
5,000 Credits are awarded.
Mission description is set to &quot;The Assassins Guild ranks you as a Murderous Thug.&quot; 
(assassins_header8)
JumpCounter is reset to zero.
Mission state is set to STAGE4

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission State : STAGE4

Perhaps you can now get back to your job as an assassin!

If kills are 1000+
AND still in G7
AND at least 9 jumps have been made since seeing the last mission briefing:-

Then at the next docking hitbrief_4 will appear. The McJamefire Company has failed to pay its
protection money. The Mafia will pay you 30,000C to destroy one of their ships, currently
parked by the Orbital Repair Station near Beatle&#39;s moon undergoing repairs.

Pressing space advances the mission status to STAGE4a
Mission description is set to &quot;Destroy &quot;The Fair Wind&quot; orbiting the Augeaian Repair Facility
in the Beatle system.&quot; (assassins_header9)
Beatle is marked on the maps.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission State : STAGE4a

Nothing will happen until you are at Beatle (PN 203).

The Repair Station is a feature of the OXP and will always be there, regardless of the
mission stage. Always present will be:-

The Repair Station - orbiting the OXP moon. (beatlestat)
2 minesweepers within 2km of the station.
5 minesweepers within 5km of the station.
30 Powered Down Classic Elite Ships (undergoing repairs) near the station. (powerdown)
25 Hognose tugships towing damaged ships into the repair station (stugger)
1 Repair Crew Transporter, pootling around the station hailing the player with adverts for
the station&#39;s services. (repaircrew)
29 OXP Mega Krait Ships (with police ScanClass) will be on patrol at various points within
a 25km range of the station &amp; at various points in the system. (repairdef)
The Station&#39;s AI also launches OXP Krait interceptors to defend itself or respond 
to attacks upon the Station&#39;s customers. (repairfighter)

(plus, of Course any ships Oolite automatically adds).

In addition, if the mission Stage is Stage4a:-

Your cloak (if you have it) will be disabled (within one ly of a victim!)

Near the witchspace beacon are added 3 Krait interceptors. (guard2).
5 Krait Interceptors are added near the Main Station.
5 are added at position 0.8
3 are added 20km from Victim3&#39;s position.
3 are added 3km from Victim3&#39;s position.

The authorities know what you intend! This version of the interceptor has a version of the
killplayerAI. They will hail you telling you they know what you intend and that you are not
welcome in the system, then attack. They have police ScanClass so returning fire will make you
a fugitive!

3 Mega Kraits (also with KillplayerAI) are added 15km from the Station. (guard).
4 are added within 500m of Victim3&#39;s position.
3 are added within 1000m of victim3&#39;s position.
Victim3 is within 1km of the Station. He is a simple kill as his ship is powered down and his
AI makes him incapable of defending himself or even moving. However, he is one of 31 powered
down ships (all with ROCK scan class), so it may take you a little time to find him.

The trick to completing the mission is to remember that you are an Assassin! You are here to
destroy the Fair Wind as soon as possible and get out of town! You are not here to fight the
security ships!

You have little chance of winning a direct battle with the Mega Kraits. They are all police, the
Mega Kraits will survive an energy bomb and can q-mining is futile!
 
Fire up on one and not only will every police ship in range of the station attack you, the
station will launch more interceptors to attack you!

Victim3&#39;s Death_Actions will set the Mission state to STAGE4b.
They also set your legal status to fugitive (you just committed mass-murder of the repair crew!).

As soon as the Fair Wind dies, you can re-cloak (if you have the cloak). However, you may not
have enough fuel to jump out immediately (I choose Beatle as the scene for this hit with this in
mind - He He.) I have playtested without the Cloak and you can make a run for the sun, scoop
and get out. If you have the Cloak now is the time to use it and run for the sun!

If you escape, you will be a fugitive with at least a 250C bounty on your head. You&#39;ll need
to sun-skim and make several jumps before you are a mere offender again! (unless you are a
complete wose and escape pod to become clean again!)

Must still be in G7.
Must be docked.

A G7 News Broadcast (&quot;Hitbrief_6bott&quot;) will appear. Looks like a lot of traders are dying in
a normally safe system. Is it really down to pirates, as GalCop would have us believe?

The planet description for Ateslete (39) is changed again.
Mission State is advanced to STAGE6bott.
The jumpcounter is reset to zero.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The players cloak is disabled. The following ships are added:-

At the witchspace beacon, 10 madbattlebot ships are added (these attack the player).

Within 10km of the beacon are added 10 madbattlebot2 ships. (these search for traders, police
ships and pirates. If they don&#39;t find any of the above, they attack the player.)

The jumpcount is reset to zero.
The robotescape variable is set to 1.
The mark on the maps for Ateslete is removed.
Mission State is advanced to STAGE7.

Once the variable robotescape is set at 1, the OXP will start counting the jumps the player has
made, using the variable robottimer. Unlike the jumpcount, this variable is never reset.

Every 10 jumps a new system within 7 light years of Ateslete will become infested with
Malfunctioning BattleBots. However many jumps the player makes, they will never go beyond the 7
light year range of Ateslete (I don&#39;t want them to take over the Ooniverse!).

However Griff&#39;s battlebots have a lot of cool features, like being able to send them to sleep
with an ECM burst at the right time and then scoop them, so I&#39;d like the player to be able to
have a good look at them. This feature allows players to visit the infested systems indefinitely
to see Griff&#39;s BattleBots in action. The systems are infested in the following order:-

Qudior, Erdiares, Cemaer, Onarmala, Gegeso &amp; Esleve. (so it will take 60 jumps before all the
systems within 7 light years of Ateslete are infested).

Whenever a system is infested, its description is changed to add a comment relating to the
presence of the haywire battlebots (in addition to the system&#39;s normal description) in an
infested system, 3 haywire battlebots will be at the witchspace beacon, 5 will be added to
the general system ships and 2 are added near the Main Station.

During this phase of the OXP, there is a 50% chance of being attacked by vengeful
Hockey Fans in Nemesis ships at every launching and hyperspace jump. The chance of being
attacked continues until the player has made at least 10 jumps, killed at least
one Hockey Fan and is docked.

The DeathActions of any of the Hockey Fans (ship: revenge3) will set the mission state to
Stage7a. However, the next mission will not trigger until the jump count requirement is also met.

Must have made at least 10 jumps since seeing the last news broadcast.
Must be docked.

Then Hitbrief8 will be displayed.

The neighboring Triads keep hitting the Mafia&#39;s drug transport ships and making off with
the merchandise. A fee of 70,000 Credits will be paid if you can whack Triad Boss Yankisona
and protect the Mafia&#39;s drug ships.

Mission State advances to STAGE8a
Mission description changes to &quot;Defend the Mafia�s drug ships and whack Boss Yankisona
in the Quandixe System.&quot; (assassins_header17).
The planet Quandixe is marked on the maps.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission State : STAGE8a

Nothing will happen until you are at Quandixie (PN53).

In addition to the ships that are normally placed in the system, the Script adds a group of
battling Mafia &amp; Triad ships. The ships have AIs to make them attack each other. Space is
repopulated, for every Ship that dies a replacement is added. This means there will always
be a battle going on at this position, however long it takes the player to get there. The
Ships are added between the OXP planet and the main planet at pwm 117172 -87123 -94774.

This is a point in a straight line between the Mafia Station and the Main Planet. To find
the ships, the player needs to remember the hint given in the Briefing, that the Triads are
attacking the drugs ships &quot;ferrying Megaweed from the plantations upon Quandixe&#39;s moon Hesperides
to the main planet.&quot; The easiest way to find them is to go to the mafia station and dock. Launch
and come to a dead stop. Use your compass to find the main planet (not the station), turn and
line up with the planet and fly straight to it. There are other drugs ships and Mafia Patrol
ships in the system, but the player needs to find these ships as this is where the mark will be. Ships added:-

10 weaktriad Ships.
2 hardtriad Ships.
3 drugs3 Ships.
4 mafiaguard Ships.

(None of these ships will pose any threat to the player as their AI&#39;s are set to attack each
other. Any ship will of course defend itself if the player attacks it however)

Also are these co-ordinates are added:-

1 victim7 ship.
5 triad1 ships.
15 Minesweepers.

All these ships have a &quot;hold position, find player, kill player&quot; AI, so will cause the player
a few problems! This mission is difficult to complete in a duel! The best tactic is to locate
victim7 (he hails when you get in range and has green lasers), get a lock on him, then run,
trying to split him from the rest of the Triads. Q-mining is virtually impossible as unless the
player stumbles on a blind spot, the mine will be knocked out by the minesweepers.

Killing vcitim7 will set the mission stage to 8b.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission State : STAGE8b  

Nothing will happen until you dock.

Mission brief &quot;hitbrief-8a&quot; will appear. The mafia are pleased, but the Triads are hopping
mad with you. Their hitships will be coming for you. The Don pays you an additional 5,000
to cover you funeral expenses!

67,500 Credits are awarded.

Mission State advances to STAGE9

Mission description changes to &quot;Defend yourself from the Esreatesian Triad Hit-Ships.&quot;
(assassins_header18).

The description for the planet Esreates (PN100) changes.

The mission variable &quot;mission_assassins_killcount&quot; is set to zero.

The jumpcount is reset to zero.

The mark on the maps for Quandixe is removed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission State : STAGE9 killCount variable is less than 4 and jumps less than 5.

Once the mission state is at STAGE9, the Script adds a 50% chance of being ambushed upon
exiting witchspace and on launching by a Triad Hit-Ship (role: revenge4). Each time you kill a
Triad Hit-Ship, its death_actions advance the kill count by 1.

Once the killcount is greater than 2 (ie you have killed 3 or more Triad Hit-Ships) and
at least 5 jumps have been made, the 8th G7 News broadcast will be displayed at the next docking.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission State : STAGE9 &amp; killCount variable is 3 or more, jumps 5 or more.

As soon as you have killed at least 3 triad2 ships, then at the next docking:-

The mission text &quot;Hitbrief_9&quot; is displayed.

G7 News report that Special Branch has arrested most of the Triad Gang. They will be standing
trial soon, relying on the testimony of a Triad &quot;Supergrass&quot;

Mission State is advanced to STAGE9a
Jumpcount is reset to zero.
The description of the planet Esreates is changed yet again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission State : STAGE9a

Once the player has seen the last news broadcast and has made at least 1 jump the mission brief
&quot;Hitbrief_10&quot; is displayed at the next docking.

The Triad boss grants you pardon. He needs your services to eliminate the supergrass about
to give evidence at his trial and will pay 80,000C to exclude his evidence!

Mission description is set to &quot;Ensure that Supergrass Bi Xea&#39;nu never enters the witness
box in the Estiri System.&quot; (assassins_header19).

Mission state is advanced to STAGE10

The Description of Estiri is changed to add a warning that the Military Base is closed to
civilian traffic and all non-military ships coming within 25km of the base will be fired
upon without warning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Mission State : STAGE10

Nothing will happen until you are at Estiri (PN82). When you are:-

The Players Cloak is disabled.

A mine-field of 100 clusterbombs is added within 25km of the Military base.

40 minesweepers are added within 25km of the base. (These will disarm any q-mines the player
deploys, although he might get a mine off if he is lucky and finds a blind spot!).

30 guardbots are added within 25km of the base.

1 guarddrone &amp; 10 more guardbots, are added within 2km of the base. 

Another minesweeper are added within 1 km of the base.

Victim 8 is added at pwm 76314 17183 213478 (near the base).

Killing victim8 will set the Mission State to STAGE10a.

I have completed this mission in Ramon&#39;s MKII adder! The trick to completing the mission is
speed and cunning over brawn!

You will need fuel injectors and to arrive at the base with a good supply of fuel. Top up at
the sun if necessary. There is no way you can hope to kill the mark whilst in the mine-field.
The BattleBots and Control Drone will be slicing your shields up and the cluster bombs will
be firing ECM hardened missiles at you! You won&#39;t be able to Q-mine as the satellites will knock
it out.

Energy Bombing is suicide. It will take out the bots, but won&#39;t kill either the mark, satellites
Clusterbombs or Drone. If they get e-bombed the cluserbombs that had locked on go nuts and 
instead of firing off the odd missile spew out their whole stock! To add to your troubles, you&#39;ll
have killed military ships in sight of the station, so it is quite likely that the station will
turn its turrets on you and start launching well-equipped Asps to attack you!

The trick is to lure the Mark out of the mine-field. He is pretty fast and his AI (foolishly!)
tells him to give chase and attack you. Fuel injector towards the station and ignore all your
attackers. Your main priority is to just get a ID Computer lock on the Mark, so you know where
he is. He is the only ship with blue lasers, his ship is distinctive and he will hail you when
you come within about 5km. You&#39;ll have lots of Missiles on your tail, but just injector a bit
ideally keeping the mark with you. If you place yourself on the other side of the Station, most
of the missiles chasing you will smash into the station rather than you! If you lose him, let
you shield rebuild and make another run. Every time you make a run, you force the clusterbombs
to use up their supply of missiles.

If the BattleBots are giving you trouble, use an e-bomb, but not when in the mine-field. As
the mark is a lot faster than the Bots and Drone, he can be split away from them. If you can
get him out of the mine field he can be q-mined (although he may escape with injectors). In
any case once he is on his own he can be taken out in a dogfight. Although his energy is high
his recharge of 2 is pathetic, so he can be worn down!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission State : STAGE10a

Nothing will happen until you dock. Then the missiontext Hitbrief_10a is displayed.

You are congratulated for killing the supergrass.
72,000 Credits are awarded.

A G7 News broadcast reveals that the Eszausveian Dictatorship has constructed a weapon of
mass-destruction. The Union of Worlds has expelled Esausve, withdrawn its Stations and decided to
arm the local rebels. (This is Hitbrief_11)

Mission State is advanced to STAGE11a.

Jump Count is reset to zero.
The variable &quot;mission_assassins_war&quot; is set to 1.
The station for Esausve is set to &quot;gone&quot;.

Once the variable war is greater than 0, groups of battling Mongoose Fighters and Rebel Cobras are
added to Eszausve. Ships will now always be present until the war is over, but the number added
depend on how the war is going. As the variable increases, the advantage is given to one side or
the other. The ships are not a threat to the player, as their AIs tell them to attack each other. 
They will of cause defend themselves if attacked, but won&#39;t attack the player (or any other ship)
unless it takes sides. Added are (at war = 1) :-

At the witchspace beacon :-

Within 4km	-	15 imperial	/	 5 erebel
Within 8km	-	15 imperial	/	 5 erebel
Within 12km	-	15 imperial	/	 5 erebel
Within 25km	-	20 imperial	/	 5 erebel

Total of		65 imperial	/	20 erebel

Must have made at least 15 jumps since seeing the News Broadcast.
Have 2,600+ kills.
Be docked at a main station in G7.

An apparently simple collection job is offered. Just go to a reasearch station in Angeriri to
collect a Missile. Further orders will be given upon arivial.

Hitbrief11missile will be displayed.
Mission STAGE is advanced to STAGE11missile.
Mission Description becomes &quot;Collect a Graviton Missile from the Rebel Outpost in the
Angeriri System.&quot; (assassins_header20a)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission State : STAGE11missile.

Nothing further will happen unless the Player is at the Angeriri system. (PN 71).

If the player is in this system. Then:-

The player finds he has lost all his fuel and cloak &amp; escape pod disabled.
He is attacked (at the Witchspace Point if entering from Hyperspace or the Main Station if
entering from Launching) by Dictatorship Scorpions and fighters. These ships have cloak and
Hyperspace Jammers! They gleefully hail that they are activating their devices!

1 &quot;impjam&quot; ship, 2 imperial2 ships and 5 imperial3 ships are added near the Main Station or
witchspace beacon depending upon how the player entered the system.

The Rebel Outpost is added at pwm -571478 376544 568900. (Well outside the spacelanes).
35 Asteroids are added within 10km.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission State : STAGE11missile (and docked at the Rebel Outpost).

Nothing further will happen until the player is docked at this Outpost in the Angeriri System.

When he does so, the Script switches Oolite into a Retro Text Adventure Mode (using the Mission
Screens). The player must leave his ship and explore the deserted (or is it!) Outpost on foot.

There are 22 locations to explore, 2 objects to collect and two &quot;puzzels&quot; to solve.

Once the player completes the Text Adventure, he recives a message asking him to load up his
missile pylons with Graviton Missiles and dock at the Main GalCop Station. Gravition Missiles
can be equipped (at no cost) on the F3 screen at this station (but only at this station).

The players cloak is disabled (within 1 ly of a mark!)

The Main Fleet is in deep space, with the Mark at the rear. The fleet ships all have an AI
telling them to search for the player and kill him. If no player is found the ships head for the
planet. When the player first enters the system, none of the fleet ships will find him as they
are too far away. The fleet ships move therefore from their stating points towards the planet.
The player will be able to use the Mark&#39;s beacon to find him. As all the groups of fleet ships
are added in a straight line with the planet, the player will have to fly through the groups of
hostile ships to reach the mark. The ships are added as follows :-

from an undercover officer in the Guild. They know the Guild is real and are determined to smash
its power... (a plot teaser, if I do a follow-on).

The Mission Description is cleared.
The Description of Geteve is change for a final time.
The BugAttack and NavyBots variables are set to zero.
The unlocked variable is set to 1.
The Mission State is set to COMPLETE.

No more missions will be offered nor will any further News Broadcasts appear. The permanent
features of the OXP remain (the planets and the ships and stations that always appear in OXPed
Systems and the altered System Data). The mad battlebots will continue to appear around Ateslete.

Now that the unlocked variable is set to 1. There is a small chance of the &quot;unlocked&quot; ships
