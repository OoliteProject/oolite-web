        <h3>NumericHUDv3.27 Readme.txt</h3>
        <pre>
CommonSense &#39;Outside-the-Box&#39; Design Studios Ltd. is happy to announce the latest design in 
numeric hud interface systems for use in all ranges of space vessels. The new version 3 of 
the numeric hud pilot interface system will be in effect when the software upgrade known as 
&quot;NumericHUDv3.oxp&quot; is placed in the space vessels&#39; computer&#39;s AddOns folder. Thank-you for 
your patronage. 

THIS OXP IS A PRODUCTION OF COMMONSENSE&#39;OUTSIDE-THE-BOX&#39;DESIGN STUDIOS LTD.
Author: CommonSenseOTB



USER CUSTOMIZABILITY:

You still have the option of going to the startUp function of the numerichudv3 script
and setting the toggles to &quot;ON&quot; if you want percentage for shields and energy guages
Toggles must be set to either &quot;ON&quot; or &quot;OFF&quot;, default is &quot;OFF&quot;.

You now have the option of going to the shipWillLaunchFromStation function of the numerichudv3 script
and setting the toggles to &quot;ON&quot; if you want countdown timer and alarm sounds or messages restored from Shield Equalizers+Capacitors oxp.(If installed)
Toggles must be set to either &quot;ON&quot; or &quot;OFF&quot;, default is &quot;OFF&quot;.


COMPATIBILITY:
Oolite version 1.75.3 or better due to CTD frame callback issues in previous oolite versions.
Compatible with widescreen monitors.
Requires shield equalizer+capacitors.oxp to display capacitor gauges.
Requires scanner targetting enhancement to display target range gauge.
Target Reticle Sensitivity built into this hud. No need for the oxp.
Can be used with the Sniper Camera System oxp.
Top speed is displayed when using the Q-Charger oxp.
No dependancies.

Apr.21 2012v3-New numbers now look like numbers, numbers glow only to get your attention, which 
              makes the hud much less distracting for better playing experience, numbers created 
			  using selector drawStatusLight: which allows for both horizontal and vertical 
			  lines of a grey color or lines that pulse the color of the alert condition.
Dec.19 2011v2.1-New targetsight made from the stick sensitivity indicator and original sights.
               -target.isValid code added for target range gauge.
               -altitude gauge flag switched when ejecting to prevent checking for an invalid player.ship.position.			   
Dec.6 2011v2-Smaller numbers, widescreen compatibility, some disappearing gauges, shield capacitor gauges, proportion of planertary radius gauge for 
             altitude(to hide scale issues), cabin temperature gauge, custom missile display, missile ID feature, alert level display, 
             stick sensitivity indicator as a part of the crosshair, simplification of hud with new layout and large scanner, and finally 
             most unneeded animation that would distract has been removed and escapepod hud removed and may become a standalone eventually.			 
Aug.7 2011v1.3.2-Oversight-forgot to refresh the display on launch after a game is saved to compensate for a cleanup script 
                to remove extra equipment from the save file.
Aug.7 2011v1.3.1-Oversight-forgot to check if a script exists before checking if its variable has a condition-now fixed.
Aug.7 2011v1.3-Bugfixed fuel required problem of targetSystem with help courtesy of kaks and ahruman-thankyou.
              -Bugfixed bugs brought up by Eldon-thankyou. Hud switching problem when hyperspacing-now fixed. 
			  Problem with the crosshairs becoming duplicate after ejecting-now fixed.
			  -Script ran too long errors are almost history. The main cause: digits functions had = &quot;TRUE&quot; 
			  instead of === &quot;TRUE&quot; resulting in 16 additional remove equipments every frame and every digit 
			  when it should only be 8 and only when the color changes. Extensive testing shows the errors have all but vanished.
			  -Found a bug: shipDied did not have crosshair equipment removed-now fixed.
			  -Optimized code with === after seeing a post from Thargoid saying it is more efficient.
			  -the n/shift+n adjustable crosshair now works only in the 4 main views.
			  -added code to prevent Sniper Camera System from forcing reticle sensitivity, as the 
			  adjustable crosshair requires a reticle that doesn&#39;t change color at the wrong position.
              -Added a basic escape pod hud. Will make a better version in the future as part of numeric hud 
			  or as a standalone oxp depending on which ideas I have will work the best.
              -Added a morph transition between different conditions of the scanner, compass and some icons.
              -Added cleanup script to remove leftover equipment when saving the game.
              -the target range indicator and animated crosshair now deactivate when the scanner targetting enhancement 
			  is damaged or not there as these are both based on the targets range. Seems logical.
              -Added compatibility with Q-Charger and now shows the correct top speed when Q-Charger is activated.
              -Added toggles for percentage/units for forward/aft shields and energy gauges.		  
July.1 2011v1.2.1-Bugfixed later the same day. Crosshair equipment now will not be damaged or removed when
               a new ship is purchased and the numeric gauges will now be refreshed as well
			   when a new ship is purchased.
July.1 2011v1.2-Added warnings backlights for critical shields and energy.
               -Added an animated adjustable crosshair. The crosshair has 10 different
			   states depending on the range to the current target. There are 20 different
			   selectable positions for the crosshair for each view that store with the
			   save game and the adjustment is n/shiftn activated. 
June 16 2011v1.1-Optimized code with better variables: missionVariables removed.
               -Added a refresh to redraw damaged number pieces when damaged.
			   -result: fps improved by 5 or 6 and reduced considerably the script ran to long errors.


Author: CommonSenseOTB(thinking outside-the-box for your playing enjoyment and the improvement of oolite)
Completed: June 13, 2011 first release of version 1
NunmericHUDv3.oxp is the current version released April 21, 2012.

NumericHUDv3.oxp takes it a step beyond version 2.1.

As an improvement to version 2.1, numbers now look like numbers and glow to draw attention.
Specifically, shields, energy banks and capacitors when below normal, target range when 
hostile, speed when over normal max speed, altitude when within range of a body, cabin temp 
when over normal, fuel when low, fuel required when over the fuel available to jump with. The 
idea was to only draw attention to gauges when required, otherwise readouts are barely visible.
In this version of the numeric hud concept we now see smaller numbers just small enough to 
allow a change in the layout. The desired direction is to pursue a numeric heads-up-display 
more similar to what is available in real fighter planes today. Every gauge that can be made 
numeric now is, the first accessory numeric gauges(for shield capacitors) are now present, 
and the layout has been simplified and optimized for a better play experience. This is about 
as far as numeric huds can go using the technique of animating drawSelector:drawStatusLights 
and numeric huds will progress further when images and text can be animated. Until then, 
enjoy this new hud and have fun!


THANX AND RECOGNITION: Commander McLane and Thargoid for contributing altitude code.
                       Eldon for suggesting a PPR gauge for altitude.
                       Maik and Kaks for feedback.
					   Cmdr Wyvern for suggesting and use of contraster for v2.1 from his MilHUDv3.5.
                       another_commander for initially suggesting to use frame callbacks for v1.
					   Thargoid for showing us all the standard condition switching method and for 
					   demonstrating on the board the use of frame callbacks(good examples help alot!)
					   Everyone that contributed ideas and support on the numerichud viewtopic.
					   THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND HELP!   -Sincerely, CommonSenseOTB.

ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: NumericHUDv3.oxp requires oolite 1.75.3 or better. The frame callbacks used may occasionally 
                    cause a CTD when you die in versions of oolite earlier than 1.75.3. It is a compromise between good fps 
                    and smooth gauge animation. This prototype is carried over from v1.3/v2.1 and may still have very minor issues.
					Report your playtest results at the numeric hud viewtopic.					

TO USE THIS HUD: Unzip and drag or move the NumericHUDv3.oxp folder into your addons folder.
                 This will become your main oolite hud. If you have any main hud modifying oxp&#39;s remove them please.
				 You may use this with the Sniper Camera System.
