        <pre>Chimera Gunship OXP by Shipbuilder.

A new ship from GalTech Industries. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
Ship: -

The Chimera Gunship was originally designed, by The GalTech Industries Corporation, as a well armed gunship intended to be able to carry a large array of weaponry in order to combat the growing Thargoid threat. The weapon carrying capability together with reasonable speed and good manoeuvrability also make the vessel an attractive option for bounty hunters and pirates as well as the ideal choice for combating lager ships. With an extendable cargo capacity of 20T this vessel also caters for the smaller trader.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Standard equipment: -

Forward Beam Laser, fuel scoops and ECM.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements: -

The OXP was designed to work on Oolite 1.76 but should also be compatible with future versions (The shpdata.plist is incompatible with versions prior to v1.75 because of the use of the scan_class key). No additional OXPs are required to be installed in order for this OXP to run
