        <pre>Up until now, no one knew the fate of the mad genius Dr. Mortimus Sprocket. For years he had told them he was building an aether ship capable of leaving the confines of our own Earths gravity and traveling to other worlds! But did they listen? No! The fools! They laughed to see his gigantic zeppelin being made not of aluminium and canvas, but of steel and iron and the secret material Sprocketonium. They snickered at the preposterous Uranium Drive engines, and guffawed at his speculations of life on other planets. They did not however laugh when the monsterious bulk of the ship silently and gently lifted from the ground, not a single grin remained when the giant ship, now no more then a speck in the sky suddenly dissappeared out of sight in a purplish streak of fire accross the sky. He was never seen by human eyes again.
However... We here at D.T.T. Shipbuilders did find his spaceship! On a tropical beach on a remote uncharted planet, live a group of natives who now worship the Doctors left boot as a god. We bought the mostly intact remains of the ship from them for 3 glass beads, a sharp paring knife, two pairs of Levi&#39;s jeans (size 32 waist, 34 inseam), and a CD of &quot;Christmas with the Worlds Greatest Elvis Impersonators&quot;. We have now faithfuly restored the ship, adapted internal systems to be compatable with modern components, re-plated the &quot;balloon&quot; (it&#39;s really just a cargo hold now), Polished the brass plated cabin, and offer it to you, our fine discerning customers!
 
Let us present to you, the D.T.T. Space Zeppelin!    

Length 140m
Width 21.5m
Height 31.6m

	max_flight_yaw = 0.7;
	max_flight_speed = 300;

Tech lvl 4 and up.
	
To install, just unzip and place the .oxp folder into your AddOns folder.

There is also an Extras folder which includes the original .obj files, as well as the original texture template so you may re-color to your hearts content!

Released under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 license yada yada yada... I HIGHLY encourage you to change/modify this ship to meet your needs, I only ask that you give me credit for the original mesh/texture. Thanks and enjoy!

Also, if you are one of the many who have helped me with answers, advice, testing, or input, I thank you!
