Welcome friends! Before I show you our new offering, I would like to ask you...
Are you looking for ship that&#39;s sleek and sexy?
Are you looking for the absolute newest in Artificial Intelligence and Technology?
Do you need a ship that is both appealing to passengers as well as able to handle those big cargo contracts?
Did you remember to pack your towel this morning?
Well friends, gulp down the rest of your Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters, and let me tell you the answer to those questions and many more... It&#39;s...
.
.
.
.
.
.
42! 
Errr... I mean, that&#39;s right friends, it&#39;s the new D.T.T Heart of Gold!




She&#39;s 150 meters of pure sexy (wadda ya mean she still looks like a shower head?)!
If that old Boa just isn&#39;t getting it done for you, or that big butt Anaconda reminds you of your Aunt Bertha trying to swim up-river at the mall during a christmas sale... Then this may be the ship for you!
Here&#39;s her stats so you can see if she will fit in your garage! };]

She&#39;s 47 meters wide, 32 meters tall, and 150 meters long.
	energy_recharge_rate = 3.0;
	max_cargo = 450;
	max_energy = 475;
	max_flight_pitch = .9;
	max_flight_roll = 2.2;
	max_flight_yaw = 0.9;
	max_flight_speed = 190;
	max_missiles = 6;
	thrust = 25;

She also offers Fore, Aft, Port, and Starboard weapon positions.
Quite the &quot;steal&quot; (get it?) at only 1,000,000 cr! Available at your nearest tech level 12 planet or higher! (.2 chance, so she&#39;s a rare bird!)
Gotta go, demolishion squad will be here any minute now! };]

P.S. There is an extra folder in the oxp called Extras. Because I know the front windows look crap, I have included the texture template as well as the original .obj in case anyone out there (cough griff? cough) would like to retexture or bump-map or whatever. I may one day try to redo those windows, but don&#39;t hold your breath! Also, if you are running a trunk version, you might want to set the &quot;likely_cargo = 6;&quot; to something more like 120 - 140 or so...
As with all my ships, I HIGHLY encourage you to modify any and all stats/textures/meshes to fit your needs. I only ask credit be given for the originals.
Also, I would like to give a huge thanks Diziet Sma for all the work he put into setting up the D.T.T wiki page and for testing the H.o.G for me!!!</pre>
