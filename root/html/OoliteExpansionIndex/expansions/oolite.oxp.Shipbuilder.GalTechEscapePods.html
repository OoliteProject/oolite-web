        <h3>GalTech_escape_pods_V1.10_Readme_&amp; _License.txt</h3>
        <pre>GalTech Escape Pods OXP by Shipbuilder.

This oxp adds additional escape pod models from GalTech Industries. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
Escape pods: -

The oxp simply adds additional variation to Oolite by increasing the number of escape pod models that Oolite randomly selects. Other than the specification of these escape pods being higher than the standard Oolite escape pod their will be no alteration to the game.

This second release contains the standard base model escape capsule the GIC-E1 along with a slightly upgraded model the GIC-E2. Further escape pod models will be added over time having different specifications. 

The new range of escape capsules, developed by the GalTech Industries Corporation, will offer varying levels of comfort and performance. However even the base model, the GalTech GIC-E1, provides more spacious accommodation and outperforms standard issued escape pods with respect to both speed and manoeuvrability. This results in a faster, safer and more comfortable journey to the nearest safe haven and comes complete with personal ship and equipment insurance.
