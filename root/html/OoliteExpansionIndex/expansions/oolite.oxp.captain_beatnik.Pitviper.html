Pitviper_1_1_0_2016-10-24.oxz
=============================


VERSION:
	1.1.0 


DATE:
	2016-10-24


REQUIRES:
	Oolite Version 1.80+


FEATURES:
	This .oxp adds the powerful Coluber CPV-9333 &quot;Pitviper&quot; to the Ooniverse. What the Boa II is to the trader, the 
	Pitviper is to the bounty-hunter.This corvette-class combat vessel is the result of a joint venture between the 
	Riredian Government and the Coluber Works and Shipyards Ltd. (The HQ of the company is located in the Riredi system 
	in galaxy one and so they have very good connections to the lokal government.)

	The ships hull can not deny to be a insektoid design and thus - to human eyes - the ship looks quite ugly. Many of 
	the outer technical details can not deny to be a human design and thus - to insect eyes - the ship looks quite ugly.
	But hey! They have put a nice paintwork on it, so its o.k.! ;-)

	In the Riredian culture and religion the numbers 3,6 and 9 are very meaningful and this this circumstance had great 
	influence on the design.(E.g. the vindicator can carry 27 = 3*9 missiles; 9 energy banks; 3 engines; etc.)
	
	The Pitviper is a straightforward combat vessel, a bounty-hunters dream (and thus a pirates nightmare of course).
	The military version (Pitviper &quot;Vindicator&quot;) is not available on the civilian market. This version has no cargo 
	capacity, but can carry up to 27(!!) missiles. It�s main weapon is a reinforced military laser. This proprietary
	development of the riredian navy has 30% more penetrating power then a common military laser an is also not 
	available on the civilian market.

	The civilian version sold by Coluber is limited to a maximum of 9 missiles due to GALCOPS weapon restrictions for civilian
	spacecrafts. In the civilian version Coluber removed the automated missile reloader system and added some cargo capacity
	instead. 

	A special characteristic of the pitviper is it�s forcefield-reinforced hull. This together with the special design of 
	the hull enables the pilot to attack by ramming other ships. But be careful! If the speed is too high (or the opponents 
	ship is really big), even a reinforced hull may break. 

	If you are lucky, you may get an offer to buy the &quot;Beast&quot;, a special edition of the Pitviper. Coluber has gained 
	a exceptional permission from the Riredian Government to equip a small amount of pitvipers for the civilian market with 
	the military engines and energy banks of the the &quot;Vindicator&quot; version. Of course these vessels are rare and quite expensive. 
	But hey! They have put a really cool paintwork on it, so its worth the money! ;-)
