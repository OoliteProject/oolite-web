        <pre>ï»¿Portable Galactic Hyperdrive Unit (GalDrivePod v1.4)

The portable Galactic Hyperdrive Unit (GalDrivePod) can be pylon mounted for use when a standard drive is not available. It is activated the same way as missiles and mines, and once activated/installed works the same way as a regular Galactic Hyperdrive.
The Portable Galactic Hyperdrive Unit is available from Tech Level 12 and above, and costs 7 500 Credits. You can have as many of them as you have spare Pylons, and they can be dis-mounted and sold. 
The Portable Galactic Hyperdrive Unit cannot be accidently activated when a standard Galactic Hyperdrive is already installed, and a console warning will remind you that you already have a standard Galactic Hyperdrive fitted if this is attempted.

N.B. This OXP allows for Galactic Jumps into &#39;un-reachable&#39; systems that would normally be inaccessible. This will only be possible when you have a GalDrivePod installed. 

This equipment will have many uses, but below are a couple of fun things you can do with it.

Record attempt:
You can attempt to set a record time for a &#39;round-trip&#39; through all the galaxies. Included with this OXP is a save file which will give you an Anaconda equipped with a Galactic Hyperdrive and seven GalDrivePods, docked at Lave in Galaxy One. The idea is to launch and immediately GalJump to G2, then arm and deploy a GalDrivePod and jump to G3 and keep repeating this process until you are back at Lave in G1. Take a screenshot just before you launch, then take a screenshot of the &#39;Galaxy Map&#39; screen (F6/F6) as you emerge in each galaxy. As soon as you dock back at Lave take another. By comparing the time (on the HUD) between the first and last screenshots you will see how quickly you did the whole round trip. The intermediate screenshots are your photographic verification that you did the whole trip.
The Benchmark time is 35 minutes 29 seconds (game-time). You can register your record attempt on the GalDrivePod thread on the Oolite Forum.

Lost Worlds Grand Tour: 

The tour starts in Galaxy 6. Before you set off, buy a GalDrivePod, then starting at Adien in the bottom-left corner of galaxy 6, jump to the systems on the &#39;wrong side&#39; of the Great Rift in Galaxy 7, where you can experience planets that you would not otherwise ever see. There are a wide variety of Government types and Tech levels from a nice TL 1 Anarchy, up to some stable, Industrial worlds. You must buy a new Galactic Hyperdrive and GalDrivePod in this region, then by going down to Onteised in the very bottom-left corner, Galactic jump to the near-mythical World of Oresrati in Galaxy 8. Oresrati is remote and isolated, and with a tech Level so low you cannot buy a Galactic Hyperdrive unit there. 
Previously this has made any trip to Oresrati a dead-end one-way trip, but no more! Now you can return to Galaxy 1 using the portable Galactic Hyperdrive unit.
