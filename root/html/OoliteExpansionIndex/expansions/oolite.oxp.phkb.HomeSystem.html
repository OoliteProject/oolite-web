        <pre>Home System
By phkb (Nick Rogers), UK_Eliter, Diziet Sma and Cody.

Overview
========
This OXP seeks to add some flavour to systems that the player has made their home. Various entities in the system will now communicate spontaneously with the player, enhancing the idea that the player is well-known to system inhabitants. Benefits will also be given to the player the more they visit the system.

Operation
=========
Up to 3 systems in each sector can be declared as &quot;home&quot;. To make a system home, purchase the &quot;Home System Privileges&quot; item from the F3 Equip Ship screen. If you have already purchased 3 Home System Privileges and decide later on to move homes, you can either purchase the &quot;Remove Home System Privileges&quot; item in one of the systems where you have already made your home, or you can simply buy a new Home System Privileges in the new system, and if your maximum has been reached, you will be asked to select one of your current home systems to remove.

Once set, additional messages will be sent to the player by the station (when you are granted docking clearance, after you dock, and after you launch), police vessels, and even pirates.

There are some benefits from making a system your home that will come into play the more you visit your home system:

1. Police will always side with the player in clean-v-clean fights.
2. If you have the &quot;Docking Fees&quot; OXP installed, fees will be waived at all stations in your home system.
3. Purchasing goods from the commodities market will return a small bonus.
4. Purchasing equipment will give you a small rebate.
5. Purchasing a new ship will give you a small rebate.
6. Clearing of any offender status.
7. Auto-refuelling at aligned stations.
8. Additional bonus amounts on missions from &quot;GalCop Missions&quot; OXP (if installed).
9. Special parcel and passenger contracts.

More benefits may be added in future versions.

You also have the opportunity to invest in your home system, which can accelerate your standing with the system and provide access to more home system faster. Investment options can be purchased at any station for 10000cr.

Home systems will be marked on the galactic chart with a purple diamond shape. There will also be a note on the F7 System Data screen.

Note: Firing on stations or police vessels in a system designated as your home will result in all your home system privileges being revoked.

0.8
- Added &quot;Invest in home system&quot; item, to allow players to accelerate their status with their home system.

0.7
- Code changes as suggested by UK_Eliter.

0.6
- Disabled docking and launching messages when using the combat simulator.
- Disabled docking messages after using an escape pod.

		fieldA: [&quot;The acidity is refreshing but not overly tart, and the balance of structure to fruit is excellent.&quot;,&quot;This is a simple but very, very tasty wine that delivers lots of pure fruit flavor without a lot of extraneous bells and whistles.&quot;,&quot;Any influence from oak is virtually indiscernible, making this a very promising partner for a wide array of fish or chicken dishes.&quot;,&quot;Bright and fresh as befits a crisp wine but still generously ripe, it hits just the right balance point between structure and softness to permit stand-alone sipping or pleasing paring with a wide range of moderately robust foods.&quot;,&quot;It&#39;s fairly full-bodied, very round and very smooth in texture, with a medium amount of tannin that is far outweighed by the rich texture.&quot;,&quot;Aromas and flavors are typically Mediterranean, suggesting ripe, almost baked dark fruits, earthiness and herbal nuances.&quot;,&quot;Soft and rounded in texture, with very ripe, tender tannins in the classic mold, this is a lovely wine made with impressive skill and taste.&quot;,&quot;This is a seriously delicious wine that succeeds by packing a lot of flavor and complexity onto a medium-bodied platform.&quot;,&quot;The fruit is free from the excessively overt sweetness that unmasks many wines of this type.&quot;,&quot;The texture is so pleasing that the wine is hard not to like.&quot;,&quot;In the glass, this wine opens up beautifully to offer rich, dense and intensely flavored qualities.&quot;,&quot;This full bodied wine fills the mouth with an abundance of fruit and spice flavors and displays soft, silky tannins.&quot;,&quot;A diversity several soil types, sun exposures and vine age creates a sinfully complex vintage.&quot;,&quot;In the glass, this wine opens up beautifully to offer rich, dense and intensely flavored qualities.&quot;,&quot;This is a solid, even gutsy vintage with a dense, chewy core, excellent structure, depth and persistence.&quot;,&quot;A rich purple-violet hue, the wine shows a rich, deep fruit concentration and jamminess.&quot;,&quot;Plush tannins and dense flavors are balanced with amazing richness and toasty oak.&quot;,&quot;On the palate, bright flavors and aromas are carried by a powerful structure and well-balanced acidity.&quot;],
		fieldB: [&quot;This wine is crisp and refreshing but also deeply flavorful, featuring fruit notes recalling [4] and [4], with a shot of [4] enlivening the bright finish.&quot;,&quot;Very fresh and clean but still with notable depth of flavor and palate weight, this wine shows notes of [4] and [4], with nice accents of [4] and [4].&quot;,&quot;The lead fruit notes are [4] and [4] with a healthy dose of [4] lending complexity and backbone, but still leaving space on the stage for nice little nuances of [4], [4], and [4].&quot;,&quot;This wine shows very nice character, with notes of [4] and ripe [4], backed by accents of [4], [4] and [4].&quot;,&quot;Notes of [4] and [4] are vivid and fresh, with crisp citric edge that freshens and lifts the rich, ripe fruit.&quot;,&quot;Very nicely balanced and very broadly useful, this wine shows interesting notes suggesting both [4] and [4].&quot;,&quot;There is a juiciness to the wine as well as a hint of [4] and [4].&quot;,&quot;Notes of [4] lead the way on both the nose and palate, with just a little [4] as a sidelight.&quot;,&quot;This wine is light and admirably delicate, with real character from fresh, bright notes of [4] and with nice little sidelights of [4] and [4].&quot;,&quot;A dense color leads to forward ripe [4] aromas, with traces of [4].&quot;,&quot;The deep, tactile fruity flavors have hints of [4] and [4].&quot;,&quot;The merits of this wine are quite clear: expressive but nuanced aromas and flavors of [4] and [4] with lovely, subtle accents of [4] and [4].&quot;,&quot;This wine is soft and succulent in feel and flavor, with notes of [4] and [4] remaining in the forefront thanks to mercifully subtle use of oak.&quot;,&quot;Aromas of [4] contrasted with [4], [4] and a hint of [4] reveal that this is a wine to capture the imagination.&quot;,&quot;There are complex aromas of [4], [4], [4] and [4].&quot;,&quot;On the mid-palate, the [4] and [4] flavors from the new oak and the rich, dense [4] characters of fully mature fruit make this wine shine.&quot;,&quot;Rich [4], [4] and [4] flavors persist through the finish, highlighting the dense and complex character of this vintage.&quot;,&quot;In the nose, there are nuances of [4] and nicely-integrated [4] with a background of [4] and [4].&quot;,&quot;Enticing [4] and [4] character with [4] and [4] nuances with supple tannins, silky texture and a smooth lingering finish.&quot;,&quot;A lovely ruby red in color, this wine offers deep, fragrant aromas of [4], [4], [4] and [4].&quot;,&quot;This wine is soft yet lively on the palate, with rich flavors of [4] and [4] enhanced by a touch of [4].&quot;,&quot;Aromas of [4] and [4] pervade, with a hint of [4] incorporated in the nose.&quot;,&quot;Tight and focused on the palate with layers of [4], [4] and [4] balanced by fresh acidity.&quot;,&quot;There are complex aromas of [4], [4], [4] and [4].&quot;,&quot;On the mid-palate, the [4] and [4] flavors from the new oak make this wine shine.&quot;,&quot;Notes of [4], [4] and [4] flavors persist through the finish, highlighting the dense and complex character of this vintage.&quot;],
		fieldC: [&quot;It finishes with excellent acidity that is very well integrated with the fruit.&quot;,&quot;This is a delicious wine that will work beautifully with a range of foods, from white meat turkey to ham to meaty or mushroomy party hors d&#39;oeuvres.&quot;,&quot;It&#39;s a dry, nearly full-bodied wine with pronounced fruity flavor, and soft texture cut through by a medium amount of fine-grained tannin.&quot;,&quot;Sipped without much thought, it&#39;s fruity and flavorful enough to please guests who don&#39;t drink wine often.&quot;,&quot;This wine is slightly less fine only because it is short across the palate - it&#39;s very up-front, you might say, and lacks the length that a better wine would have.&quot;,&quot;This wine shows impressively deep color and flavor for a bottle priced at this level, and the ripe flavors are true to the place but also sufficiently reserved and serious to display a fidelity to this noble grape.&quot;,&quot;Tasty and stylish, this is a winner at a great price.&quot;,&quot;If value is your watchword, this may not be the wine for you - but if your tastes demand the best, well, consider this a must-have.&quot;,&quot;This wine is very well made, and a real contender at this price, with none of the chunky, candied obviousness that separates winners from the losers in this range.&quot;,&quot;There&#39;s really no question that this is a sophisticated wine, but it is a very welcome experience to have sophistication whispered rather than screamed.&quot;,&quot;This wine has a liqueur-like aspect to its flavor intensity, sweet tannin, and a long, velvety-textured, juicy finish.&quot;,&quot;Very fruitful entry, crisp, with a long finish, this wine promises a long life of enjoyment.&quot;,&quot;This is a rich, complex wine balanced with good acidity, making it a fine accompaniment for a wide variety of dishes.&quot;,&quot;This would be exquisite paired with richer pastas, wild mushroom risotto, grilled salmon and herb-crusted pork tenderloin.&quot;,&quot;A well-balanced acidity accentuates the fine tannins which carry through to the long finish.&quot;,&quot;The wine is bright and clear with a long full textured finish.&quot;,&quot;The lingering finish goes on and on.&quot;,&quot;With its dark, saturated purple color, this wine roars with powerful aromas and flavors.&quot;,&quot;When you think you&#39;ve wrung every note out of this wine, it&#39;s leathery nose returns like an old friend for a stellar finish.&quot;,&quot;Rough and workmanlike, this wine pleases without complexity, like a well-laid laminate floor.&quot;],
