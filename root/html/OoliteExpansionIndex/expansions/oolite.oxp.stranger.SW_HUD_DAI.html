This is tweaked and upgraded version of Robert Triflinger (Captain Beatnik) CB_Hud_v0_8.oxp.

List of modifications:

hud.plist

A bit wider inner gap in military laser reticle.
Transparency of gauges reduced from alpha = 1.0 to alpha  = 0.25.
Decreased font size on message_gui and comm_log.gui.
Readjusted message_gui aide and location to adopt new font size.
STE reticle scaled to 1:100 instead of default 1:64.
Disabled automatic floating comm_log_gui panel.
2 MFD added.
Primed equipment indication added.
Scanner set to UltraZoom mode (x1, x2, x4, x8 x16 instead of x1, x2, x3, x4 x5).
Scanner set to non linear mode.
Default altitude dial replaced onto custom dial.
All HUD elements other than pylon-mounted ordnance and ship clock invisible in docked state.

This HUD was tested with 1920 x 1080 monitor resolution.
All changes are implemented for hud.plist only. hud-small.plist remains the same as original.

Features and dependencies

This OXP is split onto 2 versions:

SW HUD DAI (Default Altitude Dial) - stand-alone OXP without any dependencies.
SW HUD CAI (Custom Altitude Dial) - needs Hard Way 2.1 OXP, providing data source for custom altitude dial.

Use only one version of SW HUD OXP, not both!

Enjoy!

Tweaked by Stranger.
