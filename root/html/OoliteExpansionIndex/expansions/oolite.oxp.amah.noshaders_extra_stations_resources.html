Z_GrOovy_SML-Systemstations_1.0.oxp {CREATED} 17-Mar-2012 (Small  Medium Large systemstations)


*** Contents ***

This addon is based on Griff&#39;s excellent griff_coriolis_normalmapped_alt_v2.0.oxp. It will add new Tetrahedron and Octahedron stations to systems according to production quota with the same ruleset as Z grOovy System stations V1. 

In short it means:

- GBP 7000 and above (New Coriolis Station - example system: Lave)
- GBP 6999 - 4032 (Octahedron Outposts - example system: Reorte)
- GBP below 4032 (Tetrahedron Depots - example system Riedquat)

Since I worked with Griff&#39;s textures, I aligned them to the new stations as good as I could, and they don&#39;t look too shabby in my opinion. 


*** Credits ***

A big thank you to:

- Giles Williams and contributors for Oolite
- Griff for his new Coriolis station

*** Dependables/Requirements ***

Has been tested and Works with Oolite 1.76

WARNING: griff_coriolis_normalmapped_alt_v2.0.oxp is required since it borrows textures to this oxp : http://deephorizonindustries.com/griffind/griff_coriolis_normalmapped_alt_v2.0.zip

- Recommended:

NOT REQUIRED, but completes the set (Dodecahedron station) http://www.box.com/s/rpkms25cc9/1/31414656/1779573256/1

*** Notes ***

Looks at its best with shaders set to full of course, but will look good also with half and no shader support (at least on my GPU. I have an NVIDIA GT 630 M)

*** Installation ***

Drag and drop the OXP into your AddOns folder of Oolite in addition to the required oxp&#39;s

*** Legal bollox ***

This oxp is free to use, distribute, edit or alter as you see fit without my permission. It can not be used in any commercial product and cannot be sold. It is free software and should only cost you download time. I am not in any way liable if your break your Oolite installation using this oxp. Use at your own risk. I have successfully tested it and it works 4 me.


Enjoy.

*** Contents ***

Right after a few days of tinkering with the code that almost drove me nuts, here&#39;s the result:


- 5 Stations using Griff&#39;s same texture and detail as his excellent existing Coriolis Station. Station choice is governed by a planet&#39;s production quota.

You will now find:
 
- Tetrahedron depots: 		Small station found in systems with a GBP below 4032 Million C.
- Octahedron Outposts:		Medium station found in systems with a GBP between 4032 and 6999 Million C.
- Coriolis stations: 		Large (most common) station found in most systems and a GBP of 7000 and more.
- Dodecahedron stations:	XL station found in tech systems 10 and above chosen by game mechanics and not bound to GBP
- Icosahederon stations: 	XXL station found in tech systems 10 and above chosen by game mechanics and not bount to GBP

*** Optional *** 

ELS system ADD on (for Commanders who like a little landing challenge once in a while !!!

The ELS system (Elite Landing System) is a kind of glideslope ILS system as invented on earth in the 20 th century. It projects a holo of 3 beacons in front of the station&#39;s docking bay and indicates the ideal flight and alignment path. The markers are well spaced and shouldn&#39;t be a problem for pilots comfortable with manual station approaches. Hitting any of the beacons with your craft will be punished by instant death. No exceptions. That is the reason why rookies call it the &quot;Corridor Of Death&quot;. The harshness of the penalty was enforced to discourage rocket-jockeys and rookies to disregard traffic regulations at busier starports. It is safe to let the docking computer (of installed) handle your landing when an ELS is present. 
Its use is limited to Dodecahedron and Icosahedron stations and some but not all Coriolis stations with tech level 6 and above. It is not found on Tetrahedron Depots and Octahedron outposts since they are too small to accomodate the hardware to project the holo.


*** Changes to the 3D models ***

- Tetrahedron and Octahedron stations built from scratch, added details ad texture from Griff&#39;s coriolis station
- The Coriolis station is a clone from Griffs so no changes have been made visually, exept that it will not show up in systems with a GBP lower than 7000 not including. This means for the canon people that some planets like Lave, Zaonce and Tionisla for example still have their &quot;vanilla&quot; stations, and since I didn&#39;t want to change the gameplay too much visually I put the poverty barrier at 7000 Million Cr.
- The Dodecahedron station is a modified model from Kapt Kev and Griff&#39;s station (the baydoor has been realigned and rotated 17.5 degrees, which tidies the model up a bit, something Gibbon put me up to do), and has the details and textures from Griff&#39;s Coriolis station.
- The Icosahedron station is a model from PaGroove, and has been scaled up together with its docking bay with a factor of 35% to make it the biggest station in the Ooniverse. Don&#39;t worry it&#39;s only marginally visible and doesnt break the gameplay at all.

- I found this too good to leave out so I left the choice to the player as to install them or not. It does not have a bad influence on the AI ships. It doesn&#39;t kill them, because the AI seems to avoid it when coming in and out of dock, neat! also a reason why I left it in. remember, Commanders, it&#39;s YOUR game.


*** Debugging ? ***

Found something I can fix ? leave me a message on the Oolite BB, and I&#39;ll see what I can do.

*** Credits ***
A big thank you to:

- Giles Williams and contributors for Oolite.
- Griff for his textures and details.
- Commander Mac Lane for taking the time to explain the game mechanics of system population in great detail.
- Thargoid for taking up the challenge of writing a docking tunnel (which alas wasn&#39;t possible to script didn&#39;t make it ingame as intended)
- PaGroove for the model of his Icosahedron station.
- Griff and Kapt Kev for the model of his Dodo station.
- All the other enthusiasts on the forum.

*** Dependables/Requirements ***

NONE, yes I repeat, NO other addons are necessary, they are based on Griff&#39;s work but don&#39;t need them.

*** Installation ***

- A) Copy Z_GrOovy_System_Stations.oxp folder into the addons folder of your Oolite installation. (This will give you the 5 stations WITHOUT ELS)

- B) Copy both Z_GrOovy_System_Stations.oxp folder AND Z_GrOovy_System_Stations_ELS.oxp into your addons folder (This will give you 5 stations WITH ELS)

        <h3>readme/conversion.txt</h3>
        <pre>Based on Instructions by Captain Solo:
(some additional effect map channels used for engine glow)


1) Load &quot;diffuse.png&quot; into GIMP.
2) Decompose to RGB layers. You don&#39;t need the greyscale alpha layer.
3) Compose to RGB.
4) Duplicate the background layer so you now have two layers.
5) Change the layer mode of the top layer to overlay.
6) Change the opacity setting to roughly between 70% and 80%.
7) Merge the top layer down. This is your base diffuse texture
8) Load &quot;normal.png&quot; into GIMP
9) Decompose to RGBA
10) Move the alpha channel to the top, select all and copy. 
11) Paste the copied greyscale image as a new image. This is your glow map.
12) Now back to the normal map layers, delete the alpha channel.
13) Compose to RGB
14) Under the colors menu select Desaturate, and choose desaturate by Luminosity.
15) Select all and copy. This is your pseudo relief texture.
16) Go back to your diffuse texture and Paste as new layer.
17) Change the layer mode to Grain Merge, and merge it down to the bottom layer.
*a) Load the &quot;effects&quot; texture
*b) decompose to RGB, remove the alpha layer
    copy the green layer and insert as new layer on the diffuse texture,
    change layer mode to overlay and opacity to 70%
    select invert colors from colors menu.
18) Now go to your greyscale glow map from step 11, select all and copy.
*d) back to the decomposed effects texture from *a)
*e) paste as new layer
*f) set layer mode of all layers to Screen
*g) Under the Image menu choose flatten image
*h) select all and copy.
19) Back to your diffuse texture, right click on the image, select Layer, then Mask and Add Layer Mask
20) Set the layer mask to Black.
21) Cntrl V - paste the glow map on top of the layer mask.
22) Anchor the floating layer to the background image.
23) You will see two representations in the layer dialog. Click on the left one.
24) Export as your new shaderless_diffuse texture.

Finally you will need to edit the shipdata.plist file and change the material section to the following:
materials = 
{ 
&quot;Hull&quot; = 
{ 
diffuse_map = &quot;shaderless_diffuse.png&quot;; 
specular_color = ( 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 ); 
shininess = 5; 
emission_map = { name = &quot;shaderless_diffuse.png&quot;; extract_channel = &quot;a&quot;; }; 
emission_modulate_color = (0.9926, 0.9686, 0.7325); 
}; 
};

Good luck.

        <pre>Dertien&#39;s Z_GrOovy SML + Gray M+S Systemstations, Griff&#39;s Gray Coriolis and Trade Outpost


An oxp for Oolite that adds Griff&#39;s gray Coriolis and Tradeoutpost, Dertien&#39;s alternate and extra models (grey G_stations and new SML_Stations) of the standard system stations plus two smaller
additional ones to increasing the variety of dockables. 
 
Overview:

In this OXP the textures were modified so they render well on GPU&#39;s that do not support OpenGL shading language.
The clever procedure how to convert was developed by Captain SOLO. The shipdata playlist was cleaned up and updated for Oolite v1.80, 
a smaller bug that  prevented auto docking fixed and some standard flashers were added.



Requirements:
Tested with Oolite 1.80. No dependencies. 

Installation:

This package consists of three packages: 
* The base resource oxp you need in any case.

* The replacement oxp changes the system stations to use only the greyish Z_Groovy Ico, Dodo,Cori plus two smaller extra 
  tetra- and octahedron stations, replacing the default Griff stations.
* The additional oxp adds all stations (including the greyish G_systemstations, plus three extra Griff style tetra, octa and ico stations) to
  the pool of stations you can encounter in game.
  
Choose either the additional or the replacement oxp and unzip, copy it plus the resource oxp into your OXP folder 
(e.g. on Linux into: ~/.Oolite/AddOns/ )


Credits or rather &quot;Standing on shoulders of giants&quot;:
* Griff, for his marvelous normalmapped ships -&gt; http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Griff_Industries
  * Gray Coriolis
  * Trade Outpost

* Captn Kev Dodo Model

* Dertien, for coming up with more standard stations that follow Griff&#39;s look and feel.

* Captain Solo, who invented a clever way to convert them for computers with shaderless GPUs and helped me 
  extensively to explain how it was done for his noshader shipset (now default ships for 1.80)

        <pre>GalCop Trade Outpost 

Following long-running protests from traders about the outmoded commercial facilities on Coriolis stations, the Galactic Co-operative grudgingly promised to 
replace these ageing structures. Technology-transfer statutes prevented the Co-operative from simply using the Dodec, Ico or other advanced designs, but there 
was another model available: the constore. Already popular with pilots for their efficient service and mercantile focus, and built entirely with public-domain 
technology, the constore seemed to be the ideal solution. Eager for a quick and low-cost fix, the Co-operative placed a string of orders with the 
Constore Consortium. 

But, as the planners began to realise, a main system station is not a constore. A Co-op main station is something far more than just a trading centre. It is a 
meeting place; an embassy; the central bureaucracy for all local-volume government above the atmosphere; and the command-and-control nexus for the Galactic Navy 
in the 95% of systems that do not host a Naval SecCom. 

The conversion costs soared. Just refitting the constore&#39;s defensive fighter bays � originally designed for small, undemanding ex-Navy Sidewinders � to accommodate
high-performance GalCop Vipers threatened to rupture many poorer systems&#39; capital budgets. Worse, although the stations were built with PD tech, crucial parts 
of the trade hall, loading docks and internal traffic-management systems turned out to be proprietary, and surprisingly high annual leasing fees to the Constore 
Consortium had slipped unnoticed into the contract the Co-operative had signed so hastily. 

Worse still was the realisation that the new stations&#39; projected profitability depended on running them like constores � specifically, they counted on income 
from the riot of advertising that festoons the average Tescoo, Pi-42 or Star store, not to mention a brisk and lucrative trade in controlled commodities. 
Co-op rules on visual cultural sensitivity placed strict limitations on selling advertising as a revenue stream, and established regulations barred the export 
of narcotics, slaves or firearms from system stations, except under license and only to the local planet. 

In short, the entire project was a legal, logistical and financial nightmare, a stupendous blunder in the grand old tradition of the Co-operative. After numerous 
inquiries, widespread sackings, eighteen demotions, eleven resignations and two suicides, the project was cancelled. The Merchants&#39; Guild roared their 
disapproval, and the Constore Consortium launched an enormous claim for breach of contract combined with a class action suit on behalf of their shareholders for 
loss of earnings and mental anguish. Eventually, no doubt, some unsatisfactory compromise will be hammered out, and all parties will retire in a welter of 
accusations and buck-passing � also in the grand old tradition of the Co-operative. Meanwhile, a handful GalCop Trade Outposts circle a few embarrassed worlds, 
monuments to the Co-operative&#39;s less-than-glorious record in decision-making.

- reduce the appearance of the station. Now it replaces only the 10% of coriolis
- Changes to the model (made by Griff) in order to be even more deferent from the constores
- Added a requires.plist
