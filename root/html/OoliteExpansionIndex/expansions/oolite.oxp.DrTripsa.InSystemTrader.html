        <pre>In System Trader OXP

Version 1.40
(req 1.77+)

Oolite has lacked a certain capability, that is to cater to the less wanderlust-full In System Trader. After all, a single system typically has loads of opportunity. 

All those ships flying in and out of the main station all day and yet none of the stock or prices change to reflect this unless one braves witchspace...? What&#39;s an In System Trader to do?

Well, install this OXP for one!

What it does:

One item type is cycled randomly, ammount and price, while you are in system and not docked, this happens periodically based on how active the system is (More traders =  more often). Prices will always fall within system averages so don&#39;t go expecting to find 0.1cr computers and impossible deals like that!
The more you trade in system the more your in system reputation grows, beware though, knowing more people also means being known!
What it does not do:

Illegal and or otherwise controlled goods will not be refreshed, Vinnie the Blue Rodent is good... but not that good.

Install this OXP as you would any other.

Notes: 

Yes, this makes it possible to make a (meager) living without witching out to other systems, however, all main station prices will stay well within system average so the real credits remain deeper out in the black. 

It is advised to use this OXP with other OXP&#39;s that provide other trade station/locations in system, Such as Y.A.H., HOopyCasinos, etc.

(as of 1.30)
About the Tripsa Tel-com Autonomous Market Watch (A.M.W.) Unit 
     While GalCop heavily encrypts Market Data to prevent price manuipulation, the AMW carefully applies bitshifts and fourier transforms to inform its user of changes in the local system main market. It can identify the commodity which has had a change in price and or availability and prompts the user to view their Market Datascreen.
     Price: 500cr
     Availability: Tech level 9 and above systems.
