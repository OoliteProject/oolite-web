        <h3>Energy Equipment v1.11 ReadMe.txt</h3>
        <pre>Energy Equipment OXP by Thargoid.

The Ships Systems Department of the Aquarian Shipbuilding Corporation would like to present to you their latest products, the Emergency Charge Device and the Emergency Energy Unit. Compatible with all known ships, they are a handy boost to any harassed commander on the go!

--------------------------------------------------------------

Equipment:

* Emergency Charge Device (ECD) - a pylon-mounted piece which when activated transfers an emergency boost of energy to the ships reserves. Single-use item, although multiple can be purchased. Note that it doesn&#39;t increase the ship&#39;s energy capacity, any excess charge on use is dissipated.
* Emergency Energy Unit (EEU) - an upgraded version of the ECD, fitted internally directly to the ships systems and activated automatically when the ships energy reserves get critically low. Again a single use device that must be replaced after it&#39;s activated.

--------------------------------------------------------------

License:

This OXP is released under the Creative Commons Attribution - Non-Commercial - Share Alike 3.0 license with the following clauses:

* Whilst you are free (and encouraged) to re-use any of the scripting, models or texturing in this OXP, the usage must be distinct from that within this OXP. Unique identifiers such as (but not limited to) unique shipdata.plist entity keys, mission variables, script names (this.name), equipment identity strings (EQ_), description list arrays and entity roles must not be re-used without prior agreement.
* rebundling of this OXP within another distribution is permitted as long as it is unchanged. The following derivates however are permitted and except from the above:
	* the conversion of files between XML and openStep.
	* the merging of files with other files of the same type from other OXPs.
* Even though it is not compulsory, if you are re-using any sizable or recognisable piece of this OXP, please let me know :)

--------------------------------------------------------------


Instructions:

Unzip the file, and then move the folder &quot;Energy Equipment 1.11.oxp&quot; to the AddOns directory of your Oolite installation. Then start the game up whilst holding down the shift key (until the spinning Cobra Mk II screen appears) and the equipment should be added and available for purchase from sufficiently high-tech systems. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Version history:

20/08/2008 - Version 1.00, Initial release.
20/08/2008 - Version 1.01, fixed typo in ECD config which stops it working properly
21/08/2008 - Version 1.02, removed missile role from ECD, to stop rogue use by NPCs (thanks to Eric Walsh for the test)
04/11/2008 - Version 1.03, script update for compatability with v1.72.
24/03/2010 - Version 1.10, scripting update for v1.74 (not compatible with lower versions)
13/02/2011 - Version 1.11, removal of upper limit, to allow running with 1.75</pre>
