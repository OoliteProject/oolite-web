Z_GrOovy_YellOo_Cab_Variety_Pack.oxp  {UPDATED} 27-Jan-2011
 

*** Contents ***

YellOo cab taxi services fly the utility vehicle of choice; the Moray starboat. Reliable, cheap to run and almost maintance free...
This is a Griff&#39;s replacement model and texture pack for Smiv&#39;s YellOo cab oxp. I have meticulously duplicated smivs shipdata.plist file. So gameplay wise all the data is the same exept for the Model and the texture.  

This oxp comes with two textures in the texture folder:

-taxi.png
-taxi_alt.png

The taxi.png will show up ingame when you install the oxp (the dirty one). Just swap/rename the file taxi_alt.png to taxi.png if you want clean cabs.

I couldn&#39;t show both ingame simultaneously since all files depend on on smiv&#39;s oxp which features one taxi with one texture.

        <pre>Griff&#39;s NoShader Z GrOovy Vinyl Paintshed designs


An oxp for Oolite that adds different Z GrOovy-textured Cobra Mark Is, IIs and Sidewinders to the no shadered Ooniverse
 
Overview:
Z_Groovy/Dertien&#39;s alternative fantastic textures for Griff&#39;s ship models.

In this OXP, only the textures were modified so they render well on GPU&#39;s that do not support OpenGL shading language.
The clever procedure how to convert was developed by Captain SOLO.

Requirements:
Tested with Oolite 1.80. No dependencies. 

Installation:


Credits or rather still &quot;Standing on shoulders of giants&quot;:
* Z_Groovy/Dertien (check out his bbs and hpc ships), see Readme.old for original readme.

* Griff for his marvelous ship designs

* Captain Solo, who invented a clever way to convert them for computers with shaderless GPUs and helped me 
  extensively to explain how it was done for his noshader shipset (now default ships for 1.80)

        <pre>Z-GrOovY Variety Pack
=====================
This OXP is the work of a number of people: Dertien, Griff and Amah being the most prominent. See the files in the &quot;ReadMe&quot; folder for all the history. My involvement has simply been to bring various components together and package them up.

The pack includes all the variants in the original variety pack, but with normal maps specified so that the surfaces of the ships look better when light is reflected across them. The original No-Shaders variety pack had everything incorporated into the textures (which look fantastic) - all this does is apply the Griff normal-maps to the textures to give the surface some &quot;bumps&quot;. Also, some &quot;gloss&quot; has been applied, which will only be visible in the latest version of Oolite (1.87).

I found that the original &quot;shadered&quot; Z-GrOovY packs, on which the &quot;no-shader&quot; pack is based, were hard to find, and even when I found them, they didn&#39;t work in the most recent release of Oolite. That led to this pack being developed.

Both this OXP and the original variety pack can be installed together. In that scenario, any ships of the original pack will be suppressed in favour of these new variations. The reason for having both packs installed is that, if your ship is currently using one of the original variations, you will still be able to load the game and fly your ship. However, I would suggest using an OXP like Ship Respray to switch your ship over to the equivalent new variation when you get a chance.

Compatibility
=============
This OXP should be fully compatible with:
- Z-GrOovY No Shader Variety pack
- YellOo Cabs
- Taxi Galactica
