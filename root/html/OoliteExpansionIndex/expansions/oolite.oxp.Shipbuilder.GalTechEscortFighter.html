        <pre>GalTech Escort Fighter OXP by Shipbuilder.

A new ship from The GalTech Industrie Corporation. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
Ship: -

The GalTech Escort Fighter has been developed to provide long range escort and strike capabilities whilst being small enough to be used as a carrier based fighter. The ship�s dogfighting capabilities were therefore paramount to enable it to fulfil this role. As such the designers produced a craft that is both agile and fast but at the same time able to deliver a respectable degree of firepower.
 
One of the key roles the craft was developed for was to provide an armed escort to solar fuel collection tankers. Therefore a high performance heat protection system has been developed and incorporated in to the design allowing extended periods of exposure to high degrees of heat.
 
The basic model comes equipped with both forward and aft beam lasers and is able to carry two missiles however due to the ship design allowing for further equipment upgrades cargo carrying capacity is limited to 2T. Demand for this ship has already been high with many commercial shipment companies purchasing vessels to provide armed escort to their freighters. GalCop have also placed orders for a substantial number of higher specification vessels to supplement their fleet of Viper craft.
 
The GalTech Industries Corporation itself utilizes this ship to defend both their supply and delivery shipments and to protect the shipyard installations in the Ceesxe, Gerete and Edle systems. Also due to the relatively inexpensive retail price, wealth up available equipment upgrades and ease of maintenance the ship has quickly become popular with bounty hunters and pirate groups alike.

Ship variants: -

The ship is available as a player craft and also a NPC escort, pirate, hunter and police vessel. Each role of NPC ship has an individual texture.

The escort version consists of the same standard equipment available to the player but with the chance of a number of equipment upgrades.

The pirate version, like the escort version, may be equipped with as a number of optional upgrades.

The hunter version like the escort and pirate sports a variety of additional equipment features over and above that of the basic player ship. Being bounty hunters these ships are more likely to have a variety of upgrades fitted with a limited number known to be equipped with shield enhancers. Hunter versions invariably have the standard forward beam laser replaced with a military laser system.

The police version is an upgraded model produced exclusively for GalCop by The GalTech Industries Corporation. With an upgraded power system police vessels are capable of greater speed (0.360 LM), have an improved recharge rate (3.8), stronger shields and an upgraded laser system. Police craft also have substantially more equipment fitted as standard.
