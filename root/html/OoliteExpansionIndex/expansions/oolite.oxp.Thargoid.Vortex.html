        <pre>Vortex OXP by Thargoid.

This OXP adds a new player ship - the Aquarian Shipbuilding Corporation&#39;s Vortex. Originally designed as a military blockade runner, it combines an excellent cargo carrying capacity with the speed and muscle to cope with most trouble it may encounter. With the cooling of the sector wars some of these ships have been demobilised and made available to the private market (with a few of their more lethal features removed, but many desirable ones still in place).

The Vortex class has a number of new and revolutionary features for the discerning commander:

* AI control - integral to each Vortex is its Military AI Construct, or MAC for short. This is the vessels co-pilot, supervisor and assistant. It oversees the automated systems, plus deals with running the general ship systems.

* Multibay cargo system - specifically designed for this ship (and the forerunner of the recent civilian Hyper Cargo system), the multibay essentially gives the ship five distinct cargo bays of 30t each. Whilst only one is &quot;physically&quot; present at a time, they can be switched both in-flight and whilst docked allowing their content to be accessed and items loaded or unloaded. Due to the specialised nature of their workings, neither the civilian Hyper Cargo system nor passenger berths are compatible with the system.

* Missile bays - the Vortex features five distinct missile bays, each with five pylons. These are switchable both in-flight and whilst docked, and the current one will be auto-switched to the next equipped bay by the MAC should all items in the current bay be expended.

* Regeneration - making use of the military grade version of the well-known ASC repair nanobots, under the supervision of the MAC the Vortex can regenerate most damage that may result from combat.

* Defense systems - from its military history, the Vortex features a missile defense screen in the form of a hull-mounted microwave cannon. Due to the difficulty in targetting and aiming this (especially whilst in combat), it is entirely controlled by the MAC. The system will also auto-link to the ships ECM systems if fitted, as a further line of defense.

* Reflective plating - designed as a counter-measure for target-locking systems, this can cause attacking vessels problems by disrupting their target lock onto the vessel.

* Regenerative fuel injection - the fuel injection systems are designed to capture any unburned fuel and return it to the ships tanks. As a result the ship can run under injection for much longer than similar craft.

* Emergency micro-jumping - if energy is drained to a critical level during combat (without destroying the ship completely) and if there is even a little fuel available, the MAC will attempt an in-system witchspace micro-jump to remove the ship from the immediate danger area.


These ships are very rare and costly. A standard version with just the basics usually retails for around 2 million credits, and are only seen at high-tech systems (12+). But for this price you get a fast and maneuverable combat ship with a hauler-class cargo capacity, front and rear military lasers, four defense turrets plus the systems mentioned above. All in all a very nice ship to fly.

Verson 1.20 - The Maelstrom

As a variant, version 1.20 of the OXP introduces the Maelstrom military transport ship. This ship was built along the same lines as the Vortex, but is designed more for bulk carrying of cargo and munitions rather than as a brute force combat ship. It features many of the same features as its sister ship, but has a larger cargo capacity (3x 100t bays using the same Multibay system), at the expense of some maneuverability and offensive capability. They tend to appear less frequently on the market simply as they are such a useful vessel, both for the military and on the decommissioned markets. They do not carry turretted defense weapons, and only have 3 banks of 4 missile pylons.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Controls:

The bay switching screen is accessed by going from the manifest screen to the marketplace screen (F5-F8 whilst docked, F5-F5-F8 whilst in flight). When docked the cargo bay screen is displayed by default, whilst in-flight the missile bay screen is instead (they can be reached from one another). To aid usability the time acceleration factor is used to slow things down whilst the screen is open in-flight.

The missile bays can also be cycled through by using the &quot;select next missile bay&quot; item on the equipment screen (to aid in rapidly equipping the bays). And if the final pylon is used whilst in-flight, the MAC will automatically select the next bay with equipment in it so leave the pilot to concentrate on combat and flying.

The ships turrets (for the Vortex) can also be deactivated and retracted using the equipment select key (&quot;n&quot; in the default key mapping) and reactivated in the same way. This allows them to be controlled in situations where their firing may be undesirable but use of lasers may still be needed.

All other items are automatically handled by the MAC, and do not require any intervention from the Commander.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Compatibility notes:

This OXP is not compatible with HyperCargo, the system part of Repair Bots, the universal turret switcher, the military fuel injectors (for the Vortex, which has them as standard) or the APRIL unit.

Also due to the specialised cargo handling systems, equipment which takes up cargo space cannot be used with either ship. Passenger berths are also not suitable for this ship, as the passengers may object to going into witchspace without a ship.

And special thanks to Okti for the 1.11 error report, could have been a nasty one! And Capt Murphy for his assistance with the 1.12 fix.

Also a nod to Zireael for the concept of a freighter variant of the Vortex - cue the Maelstrom!

And thanks for Mauiby de Fug and Fatleaf for the bug report for the NPC name glitch

Lastly thanks to cim for providing nice API functions for New Cargoes to make compatibility easy, and to Albee for the bug report on the gems/gold/platinum cargo pod issue.
