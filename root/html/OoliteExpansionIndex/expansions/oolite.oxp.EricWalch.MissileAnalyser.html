\f0\b\fs42 \cf0 Missile Analyser \

\b0\fs24 version 1.2 by Eric Walch\
\
Minimum version requirement Oolite 1.73\
\

\b Overview\

\b0 This oxp adds the equipment: Missile Analyser. This analyser reacts on an incoming missile alert. On such an alert it analyses the spectrum of the exhaust fumes, speed manoeuvrability etc. On comparing these data with its database it can predict quite accurate what type of missile it is.\
\
All this information is displayed at the player console. It is up to the player how to react on this information.\
\

\b Why this equipment\

\b0 In the old days there were only &quot;missiles&quot; and &quot;ECM hardened missiles&quot;. When you fired your 
\b E
\b0 lectric 
\b C
\b0 ounter 
\b M
\b0 easurements and the missile was still coming, you knew what type of missile you were facing. With the introduction of many new missile types, (e.g. from Missiles_&amp;_Bombs.oxp) it is often not clear how to react on an incoming missile. Some have a q-bomb mounted and others don&#39;t react on chaff. You can wait till the missile is close enough to visually inspect the shape.  When you are lucky you recognise it before impact takes place. Better use this analyser for early recognition.\
\
The analyser is connected to the default 
\b M
\b0 issile 
\b L
\b0 aunch 
\b D
\b0 etector that almost every ship has on board. The MLD activates the 
\b M
\b0 issiles 
\b A
\b0 nalyser and the MA than determines what type of missile is heading for the ship. When it is a plain missile it does nothing to avoid to much cluttering on the screen. When it is a special missile, a warning giving the missile type, is displayed on screen.\
\

\b Usage
\b0 \
In normal use the pilot hears the alarm of an incoming missile. A well trained pilot will activate his EMC in a reflex. Only as a second reaction he should look at the screen. When the MA shows no message it is very likely a plain missile that will explode on ECM activation. When the MA does give a message the pilot should read it and act accordingly.\
When the pilot also has a 
\b T
\b0 arget 
\b S
\b0 ystem 
\b M
\b0 emory 
\b E
\b0 xpansion installed, the MA is connected with it on installation and with an incoming, not standard missile, it will transfer the missile location to the first position in the target memory. When the pilot has 
\b a
\b0 nti 
\b b
\b0 allistic 
\b m
\b0 issiles on board he just has to press 
\b T
\b0  (to target his ABM) followed by 
\b M
\b0  (to fire the ABM). Sometimes even a normal missile, fired as ABM, is able to destroy an incoming missile.\
\

\b Availability
\b0 \
This equipment can be purchased in all high-technical systems (10+) for a sum of 17500 Cr. At the same systems you can also sell back the equipment with a slight loss.\
\

\b Technical specifications.
\b0 \
Missiles have no transponder for easy recognition like many ships have. The key for recognition of a missile is the exhaust flame of the projectile. Depending on the manufacturer of the fuel there are small composition changes that result in an slightly different flame spectrum. Besides this spectrum every burner gives a slightly different flicker of the flame. This analyser detects these differences in spectrum and flickering and compares this with an on-board database of known missiles.\
This database has to be updated regularly when new manufacturers appear or a manufacturer switches fuel composition. Therefor the purchase costs of the MA includes a &quot;live-time&quot; update of the database. For this update it automated connects to a computer network during a maintenance. The pilot has nothing to do for this.\
\
This very sensitive scanner makes the equipment expensive. What also is expensive is the pure information in the database. This information is very well protected. To make sure this information never comes for free on the market, every analyser is booby-trapped. When not opened with the right tools it will destroy itself without any right on warranty.\
\

\b Disclamer
\b0 \
The manufacture of the MA will never guarantee the MA always gives the right result. Because some pilot could have made modifications to the missile or manufacturers could have changed missile specifications that are not yet in the database, analyses by the MA can result in wrong conclusions.\
\

\b Installation\

\b0 Drop this oxp in your &quot;AddOns&quot; folder. This will make the equipment available for purchase.\
For de-installation just remove the oxp from the AddOns folder. If the analyser was already bought, it will stay latent present until the oxp is installed again or the ship is sold. (just like any other external equipment oxp).\
\

\b Version History\

\b0 1.2	Change to work with Oolite 1.74 (and raised minimum Oolite version to 1.73)\
1.1.1	Minor change in the refunded value of the removed analyser.\
1.1 	Adapted for Oolite 1.72. Analyser can be sold again.\
1.0 	First release}</pre>
