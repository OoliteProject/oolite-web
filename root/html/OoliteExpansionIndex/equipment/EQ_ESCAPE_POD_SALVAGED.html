        <h1>Equipment Escape Pod (salvaged)</h1>
        <p>A simple emergency capsule with a life-support system. This pod passed its \&quot;real life\&quot;-test when it delivered its former owner safely to this asteroid. It was completely checked and refurbished. As the former owner chose early retirement after his month-long trip in the capsule, even the insurance is still valid. A real bargain! (Oh, and you will just ignore the smell, will you?)</p>
