<li><b>Reworked Renderer</b></li>
<p>The game's render engine has received a considerable upgrade allowing for previously not achievable graphics effects, such as bloom and other post-processing ones. The in-game shaders already contain a small library of effects that can be used by scripts if required. Combined with an upgraded default ship set, now making full use of the new engine's capabilities, visuals have taken yet another large stride forward.</p>

<li><b>HDR Support on Windows</b></li>
<p>The Windows port of Oolite can now send HDR signal to display devices that support this technology. If you have a compatible monitor or TV you can now enjoy vivid, bright and high contrast colors that seem to pop right out of your screen, while maintaining full image details in both highlights and dark areas. It is a significant boost in graphics quality; you have never seen Oolite like this before!</p>

<p><font size="1">*HDR output is emulated above for the purposes of displaying on any SDR screen. Unfortunately, HDR is a bit like the Matrix - no one can be told what it is, you have to see it for yourself.</font></p>

<li><b>Enhanced Accessibility</b></li>
<p>Provisions have been taken for easier accessibility of color blind persons in this version. Filters for protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia have been utilized to enhance the contrast between colors which are typically indistinguishable for each color blindness case. The end result is that color blind users can now tell different colors apart much more easily, making their gaming experience more pleasant than before. Also, hostile blips on the scanner are marked as Xs in color blind mode to further assist in combat situations.</p>
