<h2 id="sub1">Mobile External View Camera</h2>

<p>One of the main highlights of this release, the External View system
has been enhanced with the implementation of a free-look camera, which can
be used both as an assist for increased situational awareness and as a
tool to capture impressive snapshots that were not possible to achieve
before. The free-look camera can be activated and de-activated using Caps
Lock, when an external view is selected. When active, the pitch, roll
and yaw keys can be used to rotate it around your ship, while PageUp/Down
will act as zoom control. Mouse control is also possible, if the Left
Mouse Button is held down, while the mousewheel can be used for zoom.</p>

<h2 id="sub2">Multiple Lasers Now Available to All Ships</h2>

<p>A long-requested feature has arrived in this version. In Oolite  1.84, any
ship can be equipped with multiple laser mounts, which can be configured
either as split (laser energy output is split between mounts) or as
multiplied (each laser mount has a fully powered laser, which results in
higher combat effectiveness, but also in increased energy requirements
and heat output). The core ships have not been altered, but new different
gameplay strategies are expected to emerge with OXP ships making use of
the feature.</p>

<h2 id="sub3">Improvements to the Galactic Chart Interface</h2>

It is now possible to display information for systems along a pre-defined
route in a more automated way. Rather than having to manually select each
system and viewing its information page, you can now navigate through each
system's page without having to return to the Galactic Chart screen. On
the Galactic Chart you can now use Alt+Left/Right Arrows to select the 
previous or next system on a route respectively, for which information will
be shown. This makes route planning and navigation even more efficient than
before and will be of great help to those Commanders who keep themselves
busy in the cargo and passneger contract business.<p></p>

<h2 id="sub4">Improvements to Overall Presentation and UI</h2>

The presentation and interface of the game have been enhanced to make them
smoother and offer a better game experience. We have improved the engine's 
lighting, added fog effects when in atmosphere and we also have made changes on
the way ships are shown and presented. You will notice that they now
rotate in a way similar to the way the original BBC B version did it
on all screens showing rotating models. In addition to that, we have
further improved full screen handling on Windows and, for those using the
Expansion Pack Manager, we have added a feature under Windows for copying the 
info url of the selected OXZ to clipboard when the OXZ's information page is 
accessed. </p>


<p>Along with all these, version 1.84 fixes plenty of bugs spotted in
the previous version, enhances the OXP Verifier contained in the OXP
Developer builds and adds even more scripting methods for OXP creators
to use.</p>
