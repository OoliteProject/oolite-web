<h2 id="sub1">Much improved lighting system and graphics enhancements</h2>

<p>The entire lighting system has been reworked for this version. 
Oolite now has physically accurate specular lighting for all  ship entities. 
Furthermore, the materials system has been upgraded to enable creation 
of materials utilizing the capabilities of the new GGX lighting system 
and generate materials previously not possible.</p>
<p>But that's not all. Effect entities can now make use of opacity and this opens a whole new world of 
possibilities when designing visual effects. The screens below show examples of 
the new graphics system in action and make use of expansion packs for demonstration purposes. </p>

<h2 id="sub2">New look for planets and atmospheres</h2>

<p>Planets and atmospheres have received a visual upgrade and look better than 
ever in version 1.88. The planets are also subject to the new lighting system improvements 
and atmospheres utilize completely new and revised shaders.</p>

<h2 id="sub3">Support for up to four joysticks and flight control improvements</h2>

<p>In v1.88 we have responded to requests for a higher number of joysticks in the game. 
Users wanting to play with a HOTAS and pedals can now do so. Oolite will support up to 
four joysticks instead of the two we had up to now. Mouse wheel support is another part 
of the control system that has received notable improvements in this version.</p>

<h2 id="sub4">Scripting and AI improvements, optimizations, quality of life improvements and bug fixes</h2>

<p>In this version combat has become just a little bit more challenging with AI that deploy more complex defence 
patterns and can even decide to make desperate attacks when fleeing. Scripting additions have concentrated mostly 
on mission screens for this version, while at the same time new scripting properties have been introduced for the 
chart screens and the ship's scanner. For the Windows port, multiple monitor support is now considered complete 
and DPI scaling is fully supported also for multiple screens.</p>
