<h2 id="sub1">Overhauled Planets</h2>

<p>Probably the first thing that you will notice in this release, is how the planets' 
look has been thoroughly upgraded, receiving the following enhancements:
<ul>
<li>Shader-based atmosphere effects. Atmosphere scattering effects have been 
implemented and the planets have a new moving clouds layer applied. The 
combined result can lead to some very interesting new planetary vistas and 
adds a lot of... atmosphere to the game.</li>
<li>New ground textures generator. A new and improved Perlin 
3D based algorithm is used for generating the textures for planets. Ground detail is 
enhanced and features like mountains can now be identified from space. The 
new textures generator is available at the highest graphics detail level.</li>
<li>Lowered the default ambient light in all systems to a quarter of its 
previous value. With the introduction of the new atmospheric scattering 
effect, we found that a lower ambient light was improving further the way 
planets look. The unlit side of planets is now actually dark, creating a more 
realistic view in space. You can still adjust ambient light levels for each 
system if you want to though, just like before.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sub2">8K UHD Support</h2>

<p>Ready for 8K gaming! Ultra High Definition 4K resolutions are becoming 
standard for games. We have, therefore, taken an extra step and raised the 
maximum screen resolution reachable by Oolite to 7680 x 4320 pixels. Reports 
received from our testers indicate that Oolite loaded with expansion packs 
easily hits 200 FPS at 4K on an NVidia GTX 1070.</p>

</br></br>
<h2 id="sub3">"Easy Start" Option</h2>

<p>An alternative starting scenario is now offered to those Harmless Commanders 
being intimitaded by the game's entry difficulty level. In addition to 
the classic start at Lave with just 100Cr, you will have the option of 
starting the game at Tionisla, which is of considerably higher technological 
level, with ten times as many credits. Spend them wisely and you will be able 
to equip your ship quickly so that you can survive those first few tough 
encounters. You will still need to fight a lot and fight hard though!</p>

</br></br>
<h2 id="sub4">Customization, Scripting Improvements and Additional Features</h2>

<p>For this version, we are providing expansion pack creators with a plethora 
of scripting enhancements. New events, new methods and more control over 
game object properties are made available. In addition, more customization 
options for the player ship's HUD are delivered, making previously unachievable HUD designs 
now possible.</p>


<p>But that's not all. Listening to Commanders and Engineers requests, while 
anticipating some more, a variety of quality of life features have been added 
too, such as High-DPI support on Windows, HTTPS support for expansion packs loading, 
mouse wheel control for changing speed when piloting your ship using a mouse (Windows / Linux), 
a new option to launch the game in silent mode and more.</p>
